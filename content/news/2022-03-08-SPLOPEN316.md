Spotlight PA fights hard to keep Pennsylvania’s local and state governments accountable. Often, this fight includes wrestling with the limits of the open records law and endlessly filing Right-to-Know requests to get documents and information from elected officials.

The Right-to-Know Law, established in 2008, allows requesters to obtain public records from local and state government agencies such as police and health departments, city councils, and courts. It’s a valuable reporting tool, and in theory, offers all residents the chance to see how government works (or doesn’t). But it’s far from perfect, and loopholes and exceptions can turn otherwise straightforward requests into drawn-out lawsuits.

Join us during <a href="https://panewsmedia.org/legal-and-legislative/sunshine-week/">Sunshine Week</a> for a free virtual Q&amp;A on government transparency in Pennsylvania. Our reporters and other experts will break down their coverage, explain the limits of the records law, and inform you how you can file open records requests.
