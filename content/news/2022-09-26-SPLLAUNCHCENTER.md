HARRISBURG — As part of its commitment to empower voters to make an informed decision this November, Spotlight PA has launched a new, comprehensive Election Center 2022 website at <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/elections">spotlightpa.org/elections</a>.

The free website features a voter toolbox with key election dates, an interactive sample ballot, a campaign finance tracker, and a form to get in contact with our reporters. Plus you’ll find all of Spotlight PA’s comprehensive guides on where the gubernatorial candidates stand on the issues, how the voting process works, and how to get involved in the process.

The website will also feature stories published between now and Nov. 8 as part of our <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/series/one-vote-two-pennsylvanias/">“One Vote, Two Pennsylvanias”</a> election series that clearly articulates through policy proposals and issue-based reporting the vastly different visions the candidates for governor have for the future of our state.
