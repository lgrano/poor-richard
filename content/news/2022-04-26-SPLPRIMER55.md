<a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/"><i>Spotlight PA</i></a><i> is an independent, nonpartisan newsroom powered by The Philadelphia Inquirer in partnership with PennLive/The Patriot-News, TribLIVE/Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, and WITF Public Media. </i><a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/newsletters"><i>Sign up for our free newsletters</i></a><i>.</i>

This fall, voters will head to the ballot box to pick Pennsylvania’s next governor. The winner will shape the state’s policies, economy, and priorities for at least four years.

Long before that date, Democrats and Republicans will vote during the May 17 primary to decide which candidates make it onto the November ballot.

The candidates for governor each have their own ideas about how to reshape election policy, approach environmental issues, and invest in education, among other issues. To help inform you about the 10 candidates and their platforms, Spotlight PA is taking a close look at the themes of the primary and the people running for Pennsylvania’s top job.

On Thursday, May 5 at 6 p.m. ET, join us via Zoom for a free panel on who is running, how they plan to lead Pennsylvania, and how to spot election misinformation.

Our panelists include:

- <b>Stephen Caruso</b>, upcoming legislative reporter for Spotlight PA

- <b>Ethan Edward Coston</b>, government reporter for Spotlight PA

- <b>Sam Chen</b>, host of <i>Face the Issues</i> and political scientist and analyst

- <b>Other panelists to be announced.</b>
