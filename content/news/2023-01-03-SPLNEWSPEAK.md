HARRISBURG — Pennsylvania House Democrats and a handful of Republicans joined together Tuesday to pick the chamber’s new speaker — but not the person most expected.

State Rep. Mark Rozzi of Berks County, a survivor of childhood sexual abuse who has <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2021/03/pennsylvania-clergy-abuse-emergency-amendment-legislature/">pushed for the creation of a civil window to bring lawsuits against abusers</a>, was named presiding officer with 115 votes. All Democrats voted for Rozzi, as did 16 Republicans including those in leadership.

Rozzi’s selection surprised many Capitol watchers, as his name had not been publicly floated for the position. But what he did next was perhaps even more shocking.

In remarks made after his selection, Rozzi, who was elected as a Democrat, announced he would no longer caucus with the party and would become independent.

“The commonwealth that is home to Independence Hall will now be home to this commonwealth’s first independent speaker of the House,” Rozzi said Tuesday. “I pledge my allegiance and my loyalty to no interest in this building, to no interest in our politics. I pledge my loyalty to the people of the commonwealth.”

The position of speaker is critically important. The speaker has the power to moderate floor debate, call up bills for votes, and name the chamber’s committee chairs.

Until late Tuesday afternoon, Democrats had publicly maintained that state Rep. Joanna McClinton (D., Philadelphia), who serves as caucus leader, was their only pick for the role. She would have been the first woman to hold the gavel.

However, after the chamber tied on a motion to adjourn, state Rep. Jim Gregory (R., Blair) nominated Rozzi. Gregory is also a survivor of childhood sexual abuse and has worked closely with Rozzi on the issue.

In the weeks leading up to Tuesday — the first day of the legislature’s new two-year session — Democrats and Republicans waged a very public battle over which party rightfully controlled the chamber.

Democrats won 102 seats in November, flipping the chamber from Republican control for the first time since 2010. But on Tuesday, three of those seats were vacant. One was previously held by a lawmaker who died too close to Election Day to be taken off the ballot, and the other two were held by legislators who stepped down after winning other elected offices.

Those vacancies left Republicans with 101 members to Democrats’ 99. That tally gave the party a functional majority and left Democrats’ choice for speaker, McClinton, in need of GOP votes to take the gavel.

All three empty seats will be filled by special elections, which Democrats are likely to win. But exactly when two of those elections will be held is in dispute.

Democrats want to fill all three seats in early February, while Republicans argue two elections should be held in May at the same time as the off-year primary. The matter is currently being considered by the state’s appellate courts.

As Tuesday approached, Democratic and Republican leaders met intermittently to discuss a potential deal. Democrats pitched a number of compromises in exchange for their choice of speaker. At one point, they offered Republicans 12 seats on each 25-member committee.

Under previous rules, the majority party had 15 seats on each committee while the minority party had 10, regardless of the exact partisan makeup of the chamber. A closer margin would force compromise and complicate the path forward for policy changes.

In an email to their members, <a href="https://www.cityandstatepa.com/politics/2022/12/email-gop-warns-members-against-accepting-deals-dems-ahead-house-speaker-vote/381382/">first reported by City &amp; State</a>, Republican leaders alleged that Democrats asked GOP lawmakers to back the party’s candidate in exchange for access to grant money from Gov.-elect Josh Shapiro’s administration, a once-common tactic that has fallen somewhat out of favor in recent years.

Democrats, as well as a spokesperson for Shapiro, didn’t comment on those conversations, or on Shapiro’s involvement in the negotiations.
