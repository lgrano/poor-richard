HARRISBURG — The U.S. Supreme Court has struck down <i>Roe v. Wade</i>, the landmark ruling that established the constitutional right to abortion.

The <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/19-1392_6j37.pdf" target="_blank">decision</a> effectively gives states the right to determine how, where, and why someone can get a legal abortion, if at all.

“Abortion presents a profound moral question. The Constitution does not prohibit the citizens of each State from regulating or prohibiting abortion. Roe and Casey arrogated that authority,” Justice Samuel Alito wrote in the majority opinion. “We now overrule those decisions and return that authority to the people and their elected representatives.”

The ruling won’t have an immediate impact in Pennsylvania, where Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf has vowed to veto any efforts to further curtail access to the procedure.

But that could change as early as 2023 should state Sen. Doug Mastriano (R., Franklin) win the November election to <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2022/05/pa-primary-2022-governor-election-results/" target="_blank">become Pennsylvania’s next governor</a>.

Mastriano has said he would sign a bill banning abortion at six weeks with no exceptions for rape, incest, or the life of the pregnant person. His Democratic opponent, state Attorney General Josh Shapiro, <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2022/05/roe-v-wade-pa-governor-race-abortion-access/" target="_blank">supports maintaining access to abortion</a>.

Under Pennsylvania law, abortion is legal up until 24 weeks of pregnancy. The procedure may be performed after that if the life or health of the pregnant person is in danger.
