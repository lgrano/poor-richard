After eight years in office, Gov. Tom Wolf will relinquish his seat as Pennsylvania’s top official to fellow Democrat Josh Shapiro. 

He presided as governor during a rocky period for Pennsylvania, and his responses to climate change, the COVID-19 pandemic, the opioid crisis, and other statewide issues frequently put him at odds with Republican legislative leaders.

The end of Wolf’s term offers an opportunity to reflect on the legacy of his administration and probe the impact of his many decisions. What moments and choices define his leadership of Pennsylvania?

To find out, Spotlight PA will speak to the man himself about the policies that shaped his term and what he hopes for the future of the state.

On Thursday, Dec. 15 from 3-3:30 p.m. EST, join our legislative team on Zoom for a free Q&amp;A with Wolf on his two terms, his legacy, and what comes next for Pennsylvania.
