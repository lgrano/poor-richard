Pennsylvania’s Supreme Court has ordered counties not to tabulate undated or misdated mail ballots in next week’s election, a high-profile decision that will likely invalidate at least thousands of otherwise acceptable ballots.

More litigation is possible, however.

The justices are down a member after the September death of Chief Justice Max Baer. While they ordered county election officials not to count undated or misdated ballots, they also ordered officials to segregate and retain them. They also deadlocked three-to-three on whether counting undated or misdated mail ballots violates federal law.
