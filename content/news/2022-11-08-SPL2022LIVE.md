## Voters say crime, abortion, trust in voting systems motivated them

<i>11:51 a.m.</i>

Standing outside the back door of the Helen S. Faison Arts Academy gym in Homewood in Pittsburgh, Keith McBroom said Election Day has been “a little slow, but it’s still early.”

”Presidential elections, however, are phenomenal,” McBroom said. “People come out for those.”

McBroom — who was wearing a yellow beanie, lanyard, and nametag reading “Judge of Elections”— has held his position for 20 years. Judges of elections are typically in charge of a polling place; they keep track of votes throughout the day and deliver results to the county office after the location closes.

McBroom, who recently spent 19 days in the hospital, said mail ballots have historically been a good alternative for voters who are incapacitated.

A Democrat, McBroom paused when asked if he has ever crossed party lines.

“Sometimes,” he said. 

On their way into the Homewood-Brushton YWCA, Christopher Trowery and Stephanie Clemm said they decided to vote in person because they had doubts about mail voting.

“Yesterday, I read that 1,000 people in Allegheny County — their vote didn’t count, so they had to run down there and fix it because the dates were wrong,” Clemm said. “I just don’t trust it.”

The state Supreme Court recently ruled that undated and incorrectly dated mail ballots should not be counted. Allegheny County <a href="https://www.alleghenycounty.us/elections/incorrect,-no-date-ballots.aspx">published a list of voters whose ballots had fatal defects</a> to give them a chance to fix them.

Trowery, pulling on a cigarette, said crime was his biggest motivating issue. Clemm said she was voting “to keep the Republicans out.”

Poll worker Irene Bejide’s main political concerns were summed up in one word: “Everything,” she said, walking briskly past. <i>—Lilly Riddle, the News Lab @ Penn State for Spotlight PA</i>

## A new voter comes out for the U.S. Senate race

<i>11:48 a.m.</i>

Tuesday marked the first general election in which 18-year-old Grant Deshishku has voted.

The registered Democrat and Dickinson College student in Carlisle is coming of voting age in what he instinctively knows are polarizing times, when election decisions are not just about the candidates but about issues critical to the future of the country.

For Deshishku, abortion rights is one of those issues — he believes pregnant people should have the right to choose whether to continue a pregnancy. It is among the many reasons he voted for Lt. Gov. John Fetterman for U.S. Senate, he said.

”I’m really here for the U.S. Senate race,” he said, adding that he attended a Fetterman rally in Carlisle last week.

He wishes the campaign had been more about policy, and said he was turned off by ads aired in particular by Republican U.S. Senate candidate Mehmet Oz.

”The buzzword strategy and alliterations they use — like ‘far-left fraud’ — I really don’t appreciate it,” he said. “It’s not about policy anymore.”

Though he is a Democrat, and supports progressive candidates, he said he’d be willing to split his ticket and vote for a Republican.

 One Republican he says he can’t support is former President Donald Trump, whose politics he believes have exacerbated divisions in the country.

Despite Trump’s unfounded claims of rigged elections and unchecked fraud, Deshishku believes in the power of voting, and has enjoyed the process of casting ballots in person.

”It’s the most power we have as citizens,” he said. <i>—Angela Couloumbis, Spotlight PA</i>

## An Erie resident faces accessibility issues in more ways than one

<i>11:30 a.m.</i>

Getting around southeast Erie isn’t easy these days for Paula Best. Best, 68, has back and knee issues. She arrived at the Second Baptist Church, her polling place, with the help of a cane.

Best always votes in person and said voting by mail wasn’t an option for her — she can’t bend down far enough to reach the mail that slides through her door’s mail slot.

Her polling place also changed which doors voters enter through, which made things harder. Last year’s entrance allowed her to walk up a flat surface with her cane, while this year’s entrance had a set of stairs.

Voting is important to Best, so she made the trip up the stairs anyway and informed others of the change of doors on her way out.

Physical accessibility isn’t the only hurdle Best faced. She said she doesn’t go out often because her neighborhood of 30 years has “gone down a lot.”

“There’s a lot of drugs and there’s a lot of crime,” she said. “And then there’s landlords that don’t take care of their properties around here. They’re just out for the money, they don’t care. And they don’t care about the people that do care around here.”

Best said she doesn’t expect politicians to take an interest in changing southeast Erie anytime soon. Rather, she cast her vote for the same reason she has in years past — for women’s rights.

“I think that women should be allowed to do her own thing — her body and everything,” Best said. <i>—Makenzie Christman, the News Lab @ Penn State for Spotlight PA</i>

{{<picture src="external/s7www6bdsntpatvqwedsnzryfc.jpeg" description="For DonnaMarie Yeager, crime was the most important issue. S" caption="For DonnaMarie Yeager, crime was the most important issue. S" credit="Matt Smith / For Spotlight PA">}} 

## What’s important to Allentown voters

<i>11 a.m.</i>

Before beginning their workdays, voters in Allentown went to their local library to cast their ballots.

For DonnaMarie Yeager, crime was the most important issue. She voted for Democratic U.S. Senate candidate John Fetterman and criticized Republican Mehmet Oz’s attacks on his health.

“I had a stroke. He had a stroke. It’s not easy to recover,” said Yeager.

Other voters were more concerned about the number of election deniers on their ballots. Bill McGlinn, the interim executive director of the Bradbury-Sullivan LGBT Community Center, said that his main litmus test when choosing a candidate was whether they perpetuated false claims of election fraud.

“We have a country that’s being taken over by false prophets,” said McGlinn. “It’s become the normative piece of our political discourse — denial of truth. We’re in really serious trouble.”

McGlinn said he’s voted for candidates from both major parties in the past. He pointed to state Sen. Pat Browne (R., Lehigh) as an example of a Republican legislator who lobbied for Allentown but was rejected by his party for views that weren’t radical enough.

{{<picture src="external/531mmxv7djzzx5wy5vmmgam76w.jpeg" description="Stacey Klokocs regularly splits her ticket, but her primary concern is reducing taxes on the working class and limiting government spending." caption="Stacey Klokocs regularly splits her ticket, but her primary concern is reducing taxes on the working class and limiting government spending." credit="Matt Smith / For Spotlight PA">}} 

In the primary, Browne — who has been in his seat since 2005 — was defeated by newcomer Jarrett Coleman, an airline pilot and recently elected member of the Parkland School Board. Coleman, who beat Browne by only 24 votes, said his platform includes cutting government spending, repealing no-excuse mail ballots, and passing a gift ban for elected officials.

Mark Pinsley, the Democratic candidate for the state Senate seat and Lehigh County’s controller, has listed increasing the minimum wage, ending mass incarceration, and lowering health care costs as priorities.

Stacey Klokocs also regularly splits her ticket, but her primary concern is reducing taxes on the working class and limiting government spending. Klokocs says she’s been working since she was 12 and is concerned about the rising costs of living. She said she looks at “how [candidates] feel about the working class person.”

Klokocs said she cast her ballot in person this year because she feels she has more control. She was worried her ballot might get lost in the mail and wasn’t sure a ballot would come in time.

“For me, it’s all about being involved,” said Klokocs. “My mail only comes once a week, and I was worried was my vote wasn’t going to come in in time.” <i>—Kate Huangpu, Spotlight PA</i>

## <b>One Erie resident wants solutions to inflation</b>

<i>10:45 a.m.</i>

Paul Thelen doesn’t trust anyone when it comes to elections.

Over the past several years, Thelen, a disabled resident of Erie, found his Social Security income check stretching thinner and thinner. Now, Thelen says, almost half of it goes towards filling the gas tank in his “pig” of a pickup truck, and the rest toward home repairs and groceries for a family of three.

Thelen lives just a few blocks away from General Teamsters Union Local 397 — where he voted Tuesday — and finds most of his gas goes toward driving his daughter around and visiting family on the west side of town.

“Going to Millcreek is a quarter of a tank,” he said.

Saying only he voted Republican, Thelen hopes to put someone in office who will offer solutions to inflation and strengthen border security. His family hasn’t voted Democrat since John F. Kennedy was in office.

Thelen says he can’t trust anyone, not even the machine counting ballots inside the polling place.

“For all I know, it could be turning my vote Democrat in there,” Thelen said.

## The mail ballot count continues

<i>10:45 a.m.</i>

Across Pennsylvania, more than 1.4 million people requested to vote by mail. As of Nov. 7, 1.16 million absentee and mail ballots had been returned, according to Department of State data.

Before Election Day, some of the state’s largest counties said <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2022/11/pa-election-2022-mail-ballot-requests-data-counting-delays/" target="_blank">it would likely take until Wednesday to finish counting absentee and mail ballots.</a>

In Lancaster County, where more than 41,000 mail and absentee ballots were received as of Monday, officials expect to finish the count by midnight.

Elections director Christa Miller said roughly 25% of those ballots had been opened. As of 10 a.m., approximately 300 voters had dropped off mail ballots Tuesday at the election office as they may do until 8 p.m.

Per an order from the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, the county is not counting but is setting aside undated and incorrectly dated ballots. Miller did not have an estimate of how many of those ballots the county had received. <i>—Carter Walker, Votebeat / Spotlight PA and Sarah Anne Hughes, Spotlight PA</i>

## ‘Women belong in all places that decisions are being made’

<i>10:10 a.m.</i>

In Erie’s shivering morning cold, Jasmine Flores, 29, walked out of the Teamster Union Local 397 building after she voted.

“I have to work all day, and I have study sessions for the City Council business, so I had to come and do it early, first thing in the morning, to get it done,” Flores said.

A lifelong Erie resident and a member of the Democratic Party, Flores has been involved in community organizations and activism since 2018. She was elected to Erie’s City Council in January 2022.

Flores said the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade motivated her to vote.

“Women belong in all places that decisions are being made. So I had to show up for my sisters who need the ability and access to abortion if they have to have it,” Flores said.

Half Mexican and half Puerto Rican, Flores wants her community members to be informed about the election.

“Being informed on the candidates who are going to be making decisions that impact our lives is really important to me and making sure my community is aware of that,” said Flores. <i>—Alicia Chiang, the News Lab @ Penn State for Spotlight PA</i>

## Motivated by opposition, not support, in Cumberland County

<i>10 a.m.</i>

Joe Neville is a loyal voter because, as he put it Tuesday shortly after the polls opened in Mechanicsburg, Cumberland County, “if I don’t vote, I can’t complain.”

The 61-year-old retired state worker said he was motivated to come to the polls this year more by candidates and issues he opposes, rather than supports.

Though he would not reveal his ballot choices, he said he believes Republican nominee for governor Doug Mastriano has expressed “extreme views.” He also said he wasn’t sure what to think of Mehmet Oz’s candidacy for U.S. Senate.

“I have concerns about John Fetterman, but at least he seems like a decent man,” Neville, a registered Republican, said of the Democratic candidate.

Neville said he is not a voter who votes straight party line, and instead frequently splits his ballot. This year was no exception, he said.

Though he makes it a point to stay informed, the sheer volume of campaign literature and political news has been exhausting.

This morning, he said, as he was getting dressed to come to the polls to vote, he had CNN on.

“I said to my wife, I’m sick of this already,” said Neville. <i>—Angela Couloumbis, Spotlight PA</i>

## A Pittsburgh voter fears losing her rights

<i>9:55 a.m.</i>

In a winter coat with pins for Democratic candidates John Fetterman and Josh Shapiro, Anna Fisher, 45, an associate professor at Carnegie Mellon, stood outside the Jewish Community Center on Tuesday morning, thanking people for voting and handing out envelopes.

Born in Ukraine and raised in Russia, Fisher formerly lived in the Soviet Union, where she only got the opportunity to vote in only one free and fair election.

“I really hope that we do not lose the right to vote,” Fisher said.”A lot of people who are running supported the insurrection or they have insurrectionists on their campaign staff, and I really would like to protect democracy, not only to protect the rights we already have but also expand the rights too.”

Fisher realized how many barriers exist for people to exercise their right to vote when doing voter registration for the first time this year.

Working at CMU, Fisher said students who have moved from different dorms and apartments had to change their voter registration address multiple times. She saw how confusing it can get.

“For young people, this is oftentimes their first election and they move to different states, so it can get very confusing how to access and exercise their right to vote,” Fisher said.

Along with issues about access, Fisher had concerns about voter intimidation and mail ballots being thrown out because of simple mistakes. As a mother, she wants her two daughters to have the right to choose.

“Democracy and reproductive rights are my two reasons,” Fisher said. <i>— Abigail Chachoute, the News Lab @ Penn State for Spotlight PA</i>

## A Mechanicsburg voter who wants to ‘turn this country around’

<i>9:50 a.m.</i>

Bill Nailor came out early to vote Tuesday because, as he put it, he’s “disgusted with the federal government,” and thinks President Joe Biden is an “idiot.”

The 74-year-old self-described conservative TV junkie lives in Cumberland County in central Pennsylvania and said he voted for GOP candidates down the ballot.

“Anything I can do to turn this country around,” said Nailor, a registered Republican.

A one-time small business owner, Nailor said he voted for Donald Trump both in 2016 and 2020, and believes the last presidential election was stolen. He also believes there is fraud in elections, including this one, though experts have said repeatedly there is no evidence of widespread election fraud.

“The cheating has already begun for sure,” he said as he exited a polling place just off the main street of downtown Mechanicsburg.

A key issue that motivated him to come to the polls: immigration and securing the U.S. border.

He said he never considered voting for Democratic U.S. Senate candidate John Fetterman, who he believes was incapacitated by a stroke (<a href="https://apnews.com/article/mehmet-oz-2022-midterm-elections-health-business-stroke-cd5e3188b74933566ba5a8f95b2c426f">Fetterman’s doctors say he is recovering well</a>).

“I’m not big on carpetbagging Oz, but feel he will give us fair representation,” said Nailor of Republican candidate Mehmet Oz.

He said he likes state Sen. Doug Mastriano, the Republican candidate for governor, but is enough of a realist to know that it is unlikely the lawmaker will win. He voted for Mastriano anyway, he said.

Nailor said he never considered voting by mail, because he doesn’t trust the system. Plus, he said, he’s always voted in person: “I’m 74 years old, that’s what you do.” <i>—Angela Couloumbis, Spotlight PA</i>

## ‘Are you aware of the fake Mike Doyle on your ballot today?’

<i>9:45 a.m.</i>

The sun had barely begun to gild the treetops in Squirrel Hill as voters filed into the Jewish Community Center of Greater Pittsburgh to cast their ballots.

Yael Silk, 43, wearing a T-shirt that read “Jews for Summer Lee,” greeted and directed people as they walked into their polling station.

“Are you aware of the fake Mike Doyle on your ballot today?” Silk, an executive director, asked a couple walking by. She was referencing the Republican candidate for the 12th Congressional District, who has the same name as the retiring Democratic incumbent.

“Having to defend against name trickery is not something that I thought we would be needing to do today,” Silk said. She said Summer Lee, the Democratic candidate, will stand for women’s rights and a “multi-racial democracy.”

“Part of my Jewish identity means I know what it’s like to feel under threat for who we are, and no one should feel that way,” she added.

Mark Roberts, 67, votes in every election and prefers to do it in person.

“I’m really worried about the state of our democracy and the incredible rise of people who don’t care about science and the facts and that sort of stuff,” he said.

Andrew Thompson, 22, said it would be “a crime” not to vote, since he lives a five-minute walk away.

“I think a lot of the Democratic candidates, personally, have a lot more empathy,” the recent graduate said. “But whatever happens, happens.” <i>— Lilly Riddle, the News Lab @ Penn State for Spotlight PA</i>

## Lifelong Greene County resident cites abortion, need for jobs as reasons to vote

<i>9:37 a.m.</i>

Rosemarie Morehead, a lifelong Greene County resident, said Tuesday morning that her area is sometimes “forgotten.”

Morehead, 54, works at Blueprints, a social services agency that serves 20,000 residents of Greene and Washington Counties as well as West Virginia with 50 programs that address home, financial, and mental health needs. She hopes the redistricting of her state House district helps bring change to the area, which she says needs new jobs and an updated transportation system.

She lives in District 50, which now includes all of Greene County and part of Washington County. Republican candidate and incumbent Bud Cook is facing Democrat Doug Mason.

Through her work in social services, Morehead knows how important bringing new jobs to the area is to decrease the poverty rate.

Morehead, who voted at a polling place in Waynesburg, noted the town’s location off of Interstate 79 as a prime location for an industrial park to bring new jobs to the area.

“We could have used Amazon when nobody wanted it,” Morehead said.

She also said the overturning of Roe v. Wade was an important issue that motivated her to vote because she never thought she’d see it be reversed in her lifetime.

“It’s just unbelievable to me,” Morehead said. “As a woman, I think it’s important for us to vote regardless of what it is.” <i>—Alexis Yoder, the News Lab @ Penn State for Spotlight PA</i>

## A split-ticket voter cites economy, abortion as top issues

<i>9:32 a.m.</i>

Julia Broskey, 37, has lived in the southwest corner of Pennsylvania for less than two years. She hails from Pittsburgh and has lived in multiple states, but makes sure to vote most of the time either in-person or by mail.

She left her polling place in Waynesburg around 7:40 a.m. after she voted for candidates from both major parties (she did not name them). Broskey cited the economy, abortion, and the tight gubernatorial race as issues she kept in mind while voting.

Broskey has worked in higher education for her entire life and is currently in a three-year stint at West Virginia University. She called President Joe Biden’s plan to forgive student loan debt a “hot-button topic,” one in which she takes the opposing view.

”I don’t think it’s a good idea,” Broskey said. “Having worked in education for a long time, there are a lot of choices people have. I just think it’s taking away from those who are working people. I’m sure it’s not a popular opinion of some people in education, but there’s ways you can pay off your loans.”

Broskey said she considers multiple issues when voting in every election because “one issue can come and go.” <i>—Alexis Yoder, the News Lab @ Penn State for Spotlight PA</i>

## In Harrisburg: ‘I don’t like the election deniers’

<i>9:30 a.m.</i>

A steady stream of voters flowed in and out of the 11th Ward polling place in Midtown Harrisburg Tuesday morning.

For some, voting was a pit stop before dropping a kid off at school or heading to work. For others, such as Karen Chaney, a 65-year-old nurse, voting was their last stop after working a night shift.

Chaney, a registered Democrat, said she voted a straight ticket for the party. Like many others at this urban polling place, her top issue was protecting voting rights.

“I don’t like the election deniers,” she told Spotlight PA. “I feel like that’s dangerous to democracy.”

Near the top of the Republican ticket this year is gubernatorial candidate Doug Mastriano, a state senator who spread false information about voter fraud after the 2020 election and bussed supporters to a Jan. 6, 2021 rally that proceeded the storming of the U.S. Capitol.

Saliyma Chapman, a 29-year-old housing counselor, said she wanted to be sure “sane people who actually care for the state and the country” were in charge — “aka, the Democrats.”

She thought about casting a mail ballot this year, but, “I didn’t want it to get lost in the mail.”

The city of Harrisburg is heavily Democratic — it voted 84-14 for Biden in 2020. But it is home to Republicans, including Warren Harden, a law enforcement officer in his 60s.

Harden said he was motivated to vote by “moral issues” such as abortion, which he opposes. He voted for Mastriano.

However, he also cast a ballot for Democratic state Rep. Patty Kim. He declined to say who he voted for in the U.S. Senate race.

“They are both a little twisted,” he said of Democrat John Fetterman and Republican Mehmet Oz, “so I chose the lesser of the evils.”

As for if he can trust the results, Harden demurred: “Being a Christian, I put that in God’s hands.” <i>—Stephen Caruso, Spotlight PA</i>

## A Greene County voter on the Democratic Party: ‘They’re not one of us’

<i>9:10 a.m.</i>

Born and raised in Greene County — located in Pennsylvania’s southwest corner — Barb Stewart, 78, and her husband Ken, 82, have been Republicans all of their adult lives despite growing up Democrats.

Shortly after the polls opened at 7 a.m. in Waynesburg, Barb said the Democratic Party is no longer what she knew it to be growing up, and the Republican Party now stands more for the issues that matter to her most.

“I will not back a party that supports the killing of innocent children,” said Barb, referring to the Democratic Party’s stance on abortion access.

Abortion, however, is not the primary reason she’s a Republican. She believes the Democratic Party no longer cares about the people and doesn’t agree with its policies.

“They’re not one of us anymore,” she said. <i>—Valeria Quinones, the News Lab @ Penn State for Spotlight PA</i>

## Mail ballot counting going smoothly in Lancaster County after rough primary

<i>8:45 a.m.</i>

Lancaster County’s mail ballot counting operation was humming along smoothly as of 8:30 a.m.

Unlike in the primary — <a href="https://lancasteronline.com/news/politics/more-than-half-of-mail-in-ballots-now-need-hand-counting-due-to-vendors-latest/article_edbf4b44-b804-11eb-83fa-af03599a9d01.html">when poll workers had to remark thousands of ballots by hand due to a printing error</a> — ballots opened today were being run through scanners without issue.

“Everything is scanning, everything is going well,” Elections Director Christa Miller told County Commissioner Ray D’Agostino, chair of the board of elections.

Roughly two dozen volunteers, overseen by county staff and partisan poll watchers, ensured the number of ballots received from a precinct matched what was recorded, opened the outer and inner envelopes with a high-speed slicer, and flattened out ballots for tabulation machines.

D’Agostino could not provide an estimate of the number of ballots counted so far this morning, but said the county planned to count all ballots received before Tuesday, roughly 41,000, today. Ballots received on Election Day will be counted Wednesday.

He said that the requirement to count continuously, a mandate for counties receiving election grants under Act 88, would not be a major issue for the county as it has had experience with counting continuously in the 2020 election. <i>—Carter Walker, </i><a href="https://www.votebeat.org/"><i>Votebeat</i></a><i> / Spotlight PA</i>

## Which Pennsylvania counties are ‘curing’ ballots?

<i>7:55 a.m.</i>

Following a state Supreme Court ruling that found undated or incorrectly dated ballots <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2022/11/pa-election-2022-undated-mail-ballots-supreme-court-decision/">shouldn’t be counted on Nov. 8</a>, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-pittsburgh-pennsylvania-philadelphia-7baedef7e9d8f0466398632f60efe1e8">voters are scrambling to fix the errors</a>, the AP reports.

Under state law, a person who casts a mail ballot must sign and date a declaration on the outer envelope. Undated ballots have a missing date, but are otherwise turned in on time to county election offices.

Incorrectly dated mail ballots were <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/pennsylvania-undated-ballots-supreme-court-wrongly-dated-lawsuit-20221105.html">defined by the high court</a> as those with dates that fall before Sept. 19, 2022, or after Nov. 8, 2022. For absentee ballots, the dates are Aug. 30, 2022, or after Nov. 8, 2022.

Some counties are proactively reaching out to voters about the issues and allowing them to fix their ballots, but others aren’t.

Spotlight PA could not identify a complete list of which of the 67 counties are “curing” ballots and which aren’t. Reporters found that Clearfield, Lehigh, Montgomery, and Philadelphia are among those curing ballots.

Chester County is allowing people to fix ballots without a signature, but not those that have an issue with the date. Cumberland County would not answer the question, <a href="https://www.democracydocket.com/news-alerts/republicans-file-lawsuit-challenging-ballot-cure-procedures-in-pennsylvania/" target="_blank">citing ongoing litigation</a>.

Centre and Dauphin Counties are not curing ballots.

The state’s top election official said people who think they may have made a mistake should reach out to their county immediately. Even if your county won’t let you fix your mail ballot, you <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/fix-pennsylvania-mail-ballot-mistakes-20221028.html">have a right to vote by provisional ballot today</a>. <i>—Sarah Anne Hughes, Spotlight PA</i>

## Philly commissioners vote to reinstate poll book reconciliation, delaying results

<i>7:27 a.m.</i>

“Philadelphia officials voted Tuesday morning to reinstate a process that can catch possible double votes from being counted — and will also slow down their ability to report midterm election results over the next week.

If Pennsylvania’s high-stakes U.S. Senate race is as close as expected, a wait for results out of the state’s largest city is sure to shine a national spotlight on Philadelphia, similar to after the 2020 presidential election.” <i>— Jonathan Lai and Jeremy Roebuck, The Inquirer</i>

## Shapiro continues to outraise Mastriano in final days of election

<i>7:20 a.m.</i>

In the waning days of the race for Pennsylvania’s top job, Democrat Josh Shapiro and Republican Doug Mastriano have crisscrossed the state to rally supporters and win over undecided voters.

To bolster those efforts, the gubernatorial nominees have collectively raised millions of dollars in eleventh-hour campaign donations to help get their message out.

The candidates reported the donations in campaign finance reports filed daily over the past two weeks, chronicling a trail of last-minute donations.

As he has throughout the campaign, Shapiro has far outraised Mastriano, raking in roughly $2.4 million between Oct. 25 and Nov. 7, to Mastriano’s $475,000, records show.

Shapiro’s biggest donors continue to be political action committees run by national Democratic groups, as well as public and private unions. More than $440,000, for instance, came from the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, which has spent heavily in Pennsylvania to elect a Democrat in another marquee race: that for U.S. Senate.

Shapiro also received $200,000 from Jeffrey Lurie, who owns the Philadelphia Eagles, and $250,000 from billionaire Thomas Hagen, the board chair of Erie Indemnity Company.

In all, Shapiro has raised an eye-popping $65.2 million since the start of 2021 and spent a record $62.2 million. Compare that to Mastriano, who has raised $6.9 million in that same time frame and spent $5.8 million.

The two men have run vastly different campaigns. Shapiro has inundated the airwaves with campaign ads, while Mastriano has largely appealed to a loyal base, unable to front the cash to keep pace in ad spending.

Among Mastriano’s largest donors over the past two weeks: the political action committee affiliated with former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, which contributed $50,000. The PAC run by Mastriano’s running mate, GOP state Rep. Carrie DelRosso, also donated $50,000. <i>—Angela Couloumbis, Spotlight PA</i>
