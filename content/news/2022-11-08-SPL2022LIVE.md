## ‘Are you aware of the fake Mike Doyle on your ballot today?’

<i>9:45 a.m.</i>

The sun had barely begun to gild the treetops in Squirrel Hill as voters filed into the Jewish Community Center of Greater Pittsburgh to cast their ballots.

Yael Silk, 43, wearing a T-shirt that read “Jews for Summer Lee,” greeted and directed people as they walked into their polling station.

“Are you aware of the fake Mike Doyle on your ballot today?” Silk, an executive director, asked a couple walking by. She was referencing the Republican candidate for the 12th Congressional District, who has the same name as the retiring Democratic incumbent.

“Having to defend [against] name trickery is not something that I thought we would be needing to do today,” Silk said. She said Summer Lee, the Democratic candidate, will stand for women’s rights and a “multi-racial democracy.”

“Part of my Jewish identity means I know what it’s like to feel under threat for who we are, and no one should feel that way,” she added.

Mark Roberts, 67, votes in every election and prefers to do it in person.

“I’m really worried about the state of our democracy and the incredible rise of people who don’t care about science and the facts and that sort of stuff,” he said.

Andrew Thompson, 22, said it would be “a crime” not to vote, since he lives a five-minute walk away.

“I think a lot of the Democratic candidates, personally, have a lot more empathy,” the recent graduate said. “But whatever happens, happens.” <i>— Lilly Riddle of the News Lab @ Penn State for Spotlight PA</i>

## Lifelong Greene County resident cites abortion, need for jobs as reasons to vote

<i>9:37 a.m.</i>

Rosemarie Morehead, a lifelong Greene County resident, said Tuesday morning that her area is sometimes “forgotten.”

Morehead, 54, works at Blueprints, a social services agency that serves 20,000 residents of Greene and Washington Counties as well as West Virginia with 50 programs that address home, financial, and mental health needs. She hopes the redistricting of her state House district helps bring change to the area, which she says needs new jobs and an updated transportation system.

She lives in District 50, which now includes all of Greene County and part of Washington County. Republican candidate and incumbent Bud Cook is facing Democrat Doug Mason.

Through her work in social services, Morehead knows how important bringing new jobs to the area is to decrease the poverty rate.

Morehead, who voted at a polling place in Waynesburg, noted the town’s location off of Interstate 79 as a prime location for an industrial park to bring new jobs to the area.

“We could have used Amazon when nobody wanted it,” Morehead said.

She also said the overturning of Roe v. Wade was an important issue that motivated her to vote because she never thought she’d see it be reversed in her lifetime.

“It’s just unbelievable to me,” Morehead said. “As a woman, I think it’s important for us to vote regardless of what it is.” <i>—Alexis Yoder of the News Lab @ Penn State for Spotlight PA</i>

## A split-ticket voter cites economy, abortion as top issues

<i>9:32 a.m.</i>

Julia Broskey, 37, has lived in the southwest corner of Pennsylvania for less than two years. She hails from Pittsburgh and has lived in multiple states, but makes sure to vote most of the time either in-person or by mail.

She left her polling place in Waynesburg around 7:40 a.m. after she voted for candidates from both major parties (she did not name them). Broskey cited the economy, abortion, and the tight gubernatorial race as issues she kept in mind while voting.

Broskey has worked in higher education for her entire life and is currently in a three-year stint at West Virginia University. She called President Joe Biden’s plan to forgive student loan debt a “hot-button topic,” one in which she takes the opposing view.

”I don’t think it’s a good idea,” Broskey said. “Having worked in education for a long time, there are a lot of choices people have. I just think it’s taking away from those who are working people. I’m sure it’s not a popular opinion of some people in education, but there’s ways you can pay off your loans.”

Broskey said she considers multiple issues when voting in every election because “one issue can come and go.” <i>—Alexis Yoder, the News Lab @ Penn State for Spotlight PA</i>

## In Harrisburg: ‘I don’t like the election deniers’

<i>9:30 a.m.</i>

A steady stream of voters flowed in and out of the 11th Ward polling place in Midtown Harrisburg Tuesday morning.

For some, voting was a pit stop before dropping a kid off at school or heading to work. For others, such as Karen Chaney, a 65-year-old nurse, voting was their last stop after working a night shift.

Chaney, a registered Democrat, said she voted a straight ticket for the party. Like many others at this urban polling place, her top issue was protecting voting rights.

“I don’t like the election deniers,” she told Spotlight PA. “I feel like that’s dangerous to democracy.”

Near the top of the Republican ticket this year is gubernatorial candidate Doug Mastriano, a state senator who spread false information about voter fraud after the 2020 election and bussed supporters to a Jan. 6, 2021 rally that proceeded the storming of the U.S. Capitol.

Saliyma Chapman, a 29-year-old housing counselor, said she wanted to be sure “sane people who actually care for the state and the country” were in charge — “aka, the Democrats.”

She thought about casting a mail ballot this year, but, “I didn’t want it to get lost in the mail.”

The city of Harrisburg is heavily Democratic — it voted 84-14 for Biden in 2020. But it is home to Republicans, including Warren Harden, a law enforcement officer in his 60s.

Harden said he was motivated to vote by “moral issues” such as abortion, which he opposes. He voted for Mastriano.

However, he also cast a ballot for Democratic state Rep. Patty Kim. He declined to say who he voted for in the U.S. Senate race.

“They are both a little twisted,” he said of Democrat John Fetterman and Republican Mehmet Oz, “so I chose the lesser of the evils.”

As for if he can trust the results, Harden demurred: “Being a Christian, I put that in God’s hands.” <i>—Stephen Caruso, Spotlight PA</i>

## A Greene County voter on the Democratic Party: ‘They’re not one of us’

<i>9:10 a.m.</i>

Born and raised in Greene County — located in Pennsylvania’s southwest corner — Barb Stewart, 78, and her husband Ken, 82, have been Republicans all of their adult lives despite growing up Democrats.

Shortly after the polls opened at 7 a.m. in Waynesburg, Barb said the Democratic Party is no longer what she knew it to be growing up, and the Republican Party now stands more for the issues that matter to her most.

“I will not back a party that supports the killing of innocent children,” said Barb, referring to the Democratic Party’s stance on abortion access.

Abortion, however, is not the primary reason she’s a Republican. She believes the Democratic Party no longer cares about the people and doesn’t agree with its policies.

“They’re not one of us anymore,” she said. <i>—Valeria Quinones, the News Lab @ Penn State for Spotlight PA</i>

## Mail ballot counting going smoothly in Lancaster County after rough primary

<i>8:45 a.m.</i>

Lancaster County’s mail ballot counting operation was humming along smoothly as of 8:30 a.m.

Unlike in the primary — <a href="https://lancasteronline.com/news/politics/more-than-half-of-mail-in-ballots-now-need-hand-counting-due-to-vendors-latest/article_edbf4b44-b804-11eb-83fa-af03599a9d01.html">when poll workers had to remark thousands of ballots by hand due to a printing error</a> — ballots opened today were being run through scanners without issue.

“Everything is scanning, everything is going well,” Elections Director Christa Miller told County Commissioner Ray D’Agostino, chair of the board of elections.

Roughly two dozen volunteers, overseen by county staff and partisan poll watchers, ensured the number of ballots received from a precinct matched what was recorded, opened the outer and inner envelopes with a high-speed slicer, and flattened out ballots for tabulation machines.

D’Agostino could not provide an estimate of the number of ballots counted so far this morning, but said the county planned to count all ballots received before Tuesday, roughly 41,000, today. Ballots received on Election Day will be counted Wednesday.

He said that the requirement to count continuously, a mandate for counties receiving election grants under Act 88, would not be a major issue for the county as it has had experience with counting continuously in the 2020 election. <i>—Carter Walker, </i><a href="https://www.votebeat.org/"><i>Votebeat</i></a><i> / Spotlight PA</i>

## Which Pennsylvania counties are ‘curing’ ballots?

<i>7:55 a.m.</i>

Following a state Supreme Court ruling that found undated or incorrectly dated ballots <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2022/11/pa-election-2022-undated-mail-ballots-supreme-court-decision/">shouldn’t be counted on Nov. 8</a>, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-pittsburgh-pennsylvania-philadelphia-7baedef7e9d8f0466398632f60efe1e8">voters are scrambling to fix the errors</a>, the AP reports.

Under state law, a person who casts a mail ballot must sign and date a declaration on the outer envelope. Undated ballots have a missing date, but are otherwise turned in on time to county election offices.

Incorrectly dated mail ballots were <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/pennsylvania-undated-ballots-supreme-court-wrongly-dated-lawsuit-20221105.html">defined by the high court</a> as those with dates that fall before Sept. 19, 2022, or after Nov. 8, 2022. For absentee ballots, the dates are Aug. 30, 2022, or after Nov. 8, 2022.

Some counties are proactively reaching out to voters about the issues and allowing them to fix their ballots, but others aren’t.

Spotlight PA could not identify a complete list of which of the 67 counties are “curing” ballots and which aren’t. Reporters found that Clearfield, Lehigh, Montgomery, and Philadelphia are among those curing ballots.

Chester County is allowing people to fix ballots without a signature, but not those that have an issue with the date. Cumberland County would not answer the question, <a href="https://www.democracydocket.com/news-alerts/republicans-file-lawsuit-challenging-ballot-cure-procedures-in-pennsylvania/" target="_blank">citing ongoing litigation</a>.

Centre and Dauphin Counties are not curing ballots.

The state’s top election official said people who think they may have made a mistake should reach out to their county immediately. Even if your county won’t let you fix your mail ballot, you <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/fix-pennsylvania-mail-ballot-mistakes-20221028.html">have a right to vote by provisional ballot today</a>. <i>—Sarah Anne Hughes, Spotlight PA</i>

## Philly commissioners vote to reinstate poll book reconciliation, delaying results

<i>7:27 a.m.</i>

“Philadelphia officials voted Tuesday morning to reinstate a process that can catch possible double votes from being counted — and will also slow down their ability to report midterm election results over the next week.

If Pennsylvania’s high-stakes U.S. Senate race is as close as expected, a wait for results out of the state’s largest city is sure to shine a national spotlight on Philadelphia, similar to after the 2020 presidential election.” <i>— Jonathan Lai and Jeremy Roebuck, The Inquirer</i>

## Shapiro continues to outraise Mastriano in final days of election

<i>7:20 a.m.</i>

In the waning days of the race for Pennsylvania’s top job, Democrat Josh Shapiro and Republican Doug Mastriano have crisscrossed the state to rally supporters and win over undecided voters.

To bolster those efforts, the gubernatorial nominees have collectively raised millions of dollars in eleventh-hour campaign donations to help get their message out.

The candidates reported the donations in campaign finance reports filed daily over the past two weeks, chronicling a trail of last-minute donations.

As he has throughout the campaign, Shapiro has far outraised Mastriano, raking in roughly $2.4 million between Oct. 25 and Nov. 7, to Mastriano’s $475,000, records show.

Shapiro’s biggest donors continue to be political action committees run by national Democratic groups, as well as public and private unions. More than $440,000, for instance, came from the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, which has spent heavily in Pennsylvania to elect a Democrat in another marquee race: that for U.S. Senate.

Shapiro also received $200,000 from Jeffrey Lurie, who owns the Philadelphia Eagles, and $250,000 from billionaire Thomas Hagen, the board chair of Erie Indemnity Company.

In all, Shapiro has raised an eye-popping $65.2 million since the start of 2021 and spent a record $62.2 million. Compare that to Mastriano, who has raised $6.9 million in that same time frame and spent $5.8 million.

The two men have run vastly different campaigns. Shapiro has inundated the airwaves with campaign ads, while Mastriano has largely appealed to a loyal base, unable to front the cash to keep pace in ad spending.

Among Mastriano’s largest donors over the past two weeks: the political action committee affiliated with former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, which contributed $50,000. The PAC run by Mastriano’s running mate, GOP state Rep. Carrie DelRosso, also donated $50,000. <i>—Angela Couloumbis, Spotlight PA</i>

Like in 2020, be prepared to exercise patience this week and beyond.
