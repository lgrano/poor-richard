## Abortion, candidate enthusiasm motivate voters in Jim Thorpe

<i>5 p.m.</i>

When she arrived at her local polling place in the early afternoon, Jennifer Dages, 61, sat under the sun handing out information in support of the Republican Party.

Hours later, she’s bundled up and explaining why she got more involved in this election. Two words: Doug Mastriano.

“I love his emphasis on freedom and liberty,” said Dages. “I feel like he’s really working to make government smaller and have people make their own decisions.”

She began to follow Mastriano during the pandemic, when he streamed on Facebook daily. His dispatches made Dages feel represented, she said. He was one of the few politicians who echoed her own perspectives on the lockdown and COVID-19 vaccine mandates.

Other voters in Carbon County cited abortion as their motivating issue.

Leanne Whitehead, a speech pathologist, came to the polling place to support candidates who would defend <i>Roe</i>.

“The rights of women are key. I have two daughters myself. I’ve never feared more for what’s to come. The risks of pregnancy might require an abortion, and that’s not guaranteed [anymore],” said Whitehead.

Whitehead said she typically votes Democratic down the ballot but has voted for both parties in the past. Her concern about the overturning of <i>Roe</i> made candidate selection easy this year.

She was appalled at the treatment of John Fetterman after the recent debate, noting that she’s worked with patients with aphasia after strokes. She found Fetterman’s decision to take the stage to be brave.

Susan Hydro, a teacher’s assistant, opposes abortion.

“I’m pro-life. That gets me out to vote every time,” said Hydro.

Hydro, who’s lived in Jim Thorpe her entire life, says all other issues are secondary to limiting abortion access. While she cares about living costs, conservation, and the economy, she said abortion is the primary factor she considers when choosing a candidate.

Other voters cited party allegiance rather than specific issues.

Bob McHale, a lab technician from Nesquehonning, said he voted for Republicans down the ballot but he’s not convinced that he’ll be pleased with the work they do. He’s split his ticket in the past but he believes in the Republican platform on the economy, lowering fuel prices, and illegal immigration.

“I don’t know who’s ideal. I could have voted wrong, time will tell,” said McHale. “I basically voted more for party than person.”

Tonia McCole said she’s been registered as a Democrat since she started voting. McCole came to the polling place with her daughter after school hours. It was her first time voting in Jim Thorpe after moving from Nesquehonning last year to be closer to her parents.

She’s split her ticket in the past, but this election cycle she voted for Democratic candidates down the ballot. McCole said that Fettermand and Shapiro had more experience in government than their opponents. She added that abortion access was another major factor that affected her vote. <i>—Kate Huangpu, Spotlight PA</i>

## What to know about the election lawsuits filed so far

<i>4 p.m.</i>

As ballots are cast and tallied across Pennsylvania, important election developments are also happening concurrently in state and federal courts.

Two cases have already affected today’s process. Philadelphia commissioners this morning acquiesced to a GOP lawsuit and agreed to reinstate a time-consuming double-check for double votes, which means the city’s results will take longer.

And in Luzerne County, a judge <a href="https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2022-11-08-Luzerne-order.pdf">extended polling place hours until 10 p.m.</a> after a paper shortage <a href="https://www.wfmz.com/news/state/update-2-08-p-m-parties-petition-court-to-extend-voting-because-of-paper-shortage/article_3f1ac1b4-7a80-50de-9184-2b31c9b7d307.html">dramatically slowed voting in three dozen precincts</a>.

Other lawsuits are still active.

Two different groups have filed suit in federal court, challenging a state Supreme Court ruling that held undated and misdated mail ballots should not be counted in this year’s election. <a href="https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/01-2022-11-07-stamped-complaint.pdf">One suit</a> came Monday from U.S. Senate candidate John Fetterman’s campaign, as well as the Democratic Congressional and Senate Campaign Committees and individual voters.

<a href="https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/01-2022-11-04-file-stamped-complaint.pdf">Another was filed last week</a> by Pennsylvania’s NAACP, League of Women Voters, and other groups.

Both suits argue the state Supreme Court’s decision violated federal civil rights law — an argument that previously saw success in federal court before the U.S. Supreme Court vacated the decision on procedural grounds.

The U.S. District Court for Pennsylvania’s Western District <a href="https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/04-2022-11-08-Order.pdf">is holding a joint conference</a> on both cases Wednesday at 9:30 a.m.

Other challenges have already been knocked down. In Monroe County, the county GOP committee <a href="https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2022-11-04-Complaint-Complaint.pdf">sued late last week</a> to bar election workers from curing flawed ballots — which the state Supreme Court has held that counties are allowed to do — saying that election workers were “tampering” with ballots.

A Monroe County Common Pleas judge held Monday that he did not “find that there was fraud involved or that there was political partisanship undertaken by [county] staff,” and denied the injunction. So far, there has been no appeal. <i>—Katie Meyer, Spotlight PA</i>

## The issues motivating State College residents and Penn State students

<i>3:40 p.m.</i>

Dozens of voters cast their ballots at Saint Andrew’s Episcopal Church in State College in the early afternoon.

The issues bringing them to the booth ranged from economic concerns to abortion access to protecting voting rights.

Alby Woodruff, 53, said the economy and the rising costs of basic goods brought her to the polls. The costs of rent, groceries, and health care are all up, she said. Despite being a registered Republican, Woodruff found Democratic candidates this year to be more straightforward in their plans, she said.

This election, Woodruff said she voted straight Democrat, a first as far as she could remember. She believes there are other voters like her.

“Some of the Republicans, they just want to get rid of everything, and I didn’t want to do that,” Woodruff said. “So I voted the other way.”

The future of the American economy was on Will Kahn’s mind in the days leading up to Nov. 8. With graduation on the horizon, the senior at Penn State is looking for jobs.

Vetting candidates through this lens was more difficult than expected, the 22-year-old said. He read past interviews and tried to gather “correct information” from both sides to avoid bias, he told Spotlight PA.

“It was a tedious process but it was worth it to make myself more informed,” Kahn added.

Having voted in the 2020 presidential election, Kahn said he was glad this election, while still controversial, felt more normal.

The precinct in downtown State College is in an area that in 2020 voted for Joe Biden over Donald Trump by a nearly 3-to-1 margin, with roughly half of Biden’s votes here coming from absentee or mail ballots, according to data from the Centre County Elections office.

Ben Cardenas, 35, was motivated to vote Tuesday to “preserve democracy,” he said. Republicans have sowed doubts about the election results, he said, which worries him.

The State College resident wondered whether someone else should have run for the U.S. Senate seat being pursued by Democrat John Fetterman, who is recovering from a stroke. But his friends, who saw Fetterman in town last week, told Cardenas the candidate sounded fine despite his shaky debate performance a few weeks ago.

Justin Segal, a 20-year-old Penn State student, left the polling location unsure whether his vote will be counted. He is registered in Montgomery County and said he requested a mail ballot weeks ago.

The ballot arrived yesterday, Segal said, but the drop box on campus was closed. He came to the polling location to see what could be done but said he wants to do more research. <i>—Wyatt Massey, Spotlight PA</i>

## What redistricting may mean for one Harrisburg suburb

<i>3:30 p.m.</i>

Before this year’s redistricting cycle, the state House district that encompassed Susquehanna Township — a diverse, middle-income<a href="https://statisticalatlas.com/school-district/Pennsylvania/Susquehanna-Township-School-District/Overview"> suburb</a> of Harrisburg — was lumped in with rural Lebanon County, creating a red-leaning district despite the area’s Democratic voting patterns.

Under the new map, the township anchors <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2022/10/pa-election-2022-redistricting-maps-legislative-races/">its own blue-leaning district</a>, which appears likely to flip from Republicans.

This district was designed to have a critical mass of Black and brown voters in hopes of encouraging new, diverse faces in the legislature.

Thomas Jordan, a 29-year-old consultant, is a neighbor of the Democratic legislative candidate, Justin Fleming.

Jordan, who is Black, said voting for Fleming is one of the main reasons he turned out to vote Tuesday.

The Harrisburg area has a large Black population, Jordan noted, and the increased representation is good. But beyond Fleming’s identity, Jordan said his neighbor is “an open-minded person who can represent all citizens.”

Jordan is open-minded himself. A registered independent, he wants candidates who support small businesses, particularly Black-owned ones hurt by the pandemic. He also wants less lip service to the community from the Democratic Party and more concrete gains on issues like criminal justice reform.

Black men, in particular, Jordan said, “don’t get praised when we do vote overwhelmingly Democratic. And if we don’t vote Democrat, we’re being used.”

That being said, Jordan still will vote for the party when it makes sense to. He backed Attorney General Josh Shapiro in the governor’s race because Republican candidate Doug Mastriano seems too extreme.

In the U.S. Senate race, Jordan said he voted for the Libertarian candidate Erik Gerhardt. He doubted Republican Mehmet Oz’s authenticity and was worried about Democrat John Fetterman’s health.

Jordan wasn’t the only ticket splitter. Darrian Collevechio, a 28-year-old marketing and sales worker, lives just a few blocks away from the elementary school being used as a polling place. She’s drawn to vote by a mix of economic and social issues, including inflation concerns and support for women’s reproductive health care.

A registered Republican, Collevechio said she split her ticket — something she’s done more in recent years — but declined to elaborate on her exact choices.

“I’m pretty middle on everything,” she said. <i>—Stephen Caruso, Spotlight PA</i>

## In northern Chester County, turnout outpaces expectations

<i>3:18 p.m.</i>

Grain silos dot the northern tip of Chester County, where suburbs give way to farmland and signs supporting Republican gubernatorial candidate Doug Mastriano appear in stronger numbers.

South Coventry Township voted for Donald Trump in November 2020, but gave the former president less support than in 2016, when he won the precinct by 10 percentage points.

At Owen J. Roberts Middle School, a pick-up truck decked in “TRUMP 2020″ decals sat in the parking lot. Voters trickled in and out of the middle school gym, flanked by volunteers for both Democratic state Sen. Katie Muth and the local Republican Party.

Mark Wolfrey, a member of the county Republican central committee, said turnout outpaced his expectations by mid-afternoon, when close to 700 voters had cast ballots.

One of them, Charlene Harrington, voted because of her stance on abortion.

“I can understand how people feel about things, but it’s a life,” she said. “It’s murder.”

Harrington has always voted. “That’s my privilege as an American,” she said.

She declined to say who she voted for but said her faith as a born-again Christian guided her.

As to whether she will trust the results of the election: “We hope!” <i>—Danielle Ohl, Spotlight PA</i>

## ‘I vote Republican because they mimic my values’

<i>2:50 p.m.</i>

Linda Coffin and her husband Jeff came to their local fire station in Lehigh County just after lunch to vote, but a glitch occurred when Linda tried to scan her ballot: The ballot of the person who voted before her came out instead.

Coffin, 65, said her vote was accepted, but she was concerned about the vote of the person before her.

“I was so excited to vote and then that happened,” said Coffin. “People should vote in-person unless they’re in the military or away for work.”

Coffin said she voted for Republican candidates down the ballot and always has. She didn’t consider any candidate perfect, but preferred the Republican platform. She originally “wasn’t thrilled” with former President Donald Trump, she said, but changed her mind after seeing him in office.

“All politicians can talk a good game, but anything’s better than the other side,” said Coffin. “I vote Republican because they mimic my values. I don’t know that any Democrat matches my values.”

She said her top priorities were the economy, crime, and gas prices. She also said she is “against abortion.” Coffin used to work in a nursing home until she was fired for refusing to take a COVID-19 vaccine. She said that after the 2020 election, she stopped watching the news because she found it to be too biased against the former president.

For Jeff Hartpence, there was no perfect candidate. He said he gravitated toward the candidates who aired the fewest negative ads, rather than voting based on issues. He said he voted for Democrat John Fetterman for U.S. Senate, but said he forgot who he voted for in the gubernatorial race.

”I really didn’t like any of them but I had to vote for somebody,” said Hartpence. —<i>Kate Huangpu, Spotlig</i>ht PA

## Erie poll worker sees Little Italy community grow apart

<i>2:30 p.m.</i>

St. Paul’s Catholic Church sits between rows of small, distinctive townhouses with touches of the Erie neighborhood’s history painted on fences and sides of buildings. From the church parking lot, where most voters park, a mural reminds passersby that we’re in “The Heart of Little Italy.”

St. Paul’s is the polling station for a large area, but poll worker Maria Beckwith had only seen 45 people vote Tuesday morning — a far cry from the civic engagement her community once had. She said the polling center will be “lucky” to see 500 people turn up by the end of the day.

Beckwith said she wishes her center had to stay open past 8 p.m. to accommodate all the voters waiting in line rather than hoping people come in out of boredom.

Beckwith, 35, has lived in Little Italy for “99%” of her life. During that time, the Little Italy Beckwith knew was free of crime and voting was “huge” for high schoolers. Now, she said she hardly sees young people turn up to vote.

“When I turned 18, my god mom brought me my first voter registration,” she said, sharing further that helping family members get registered to vote is a bit of a tradition in her home. “My sister graduated a few years ago and she had no idea what any of it was about.” So, Beckwith guided her.

Beckwith sees this as a once tight-knit community growing apart and turning into a neighborhood marked by break-ins and “random” shootings. As much as Beckwith wants to see change in this area, to her, crime will only persist if the community doesn’t step up and vote.

“When I first started [working the polls], we used to be extremely busy,” she said. “But in this general area, people just don’t care. And that’s why the city’s going to hell.”

A long-time poll worker, Beckwith said she’s seen a steady decline in voter turnout and fears voting offices might become a thing of the past.

Beckwith said she wishes people would realize their vote matters on a larger scale than just presidential elections. To her, voting the right people into the Oval Office starts with voting the right people into state offices. And it’s not just longtime Erie residents whose votes matter to Beckwith, but also the refugees seeking housing here.

“Little Italy is made up of a decent population of young people,” she said. “Now, it’s more refugees because we have more housing. They need to understand you’re a part of the state, you’re a part of the city. You still have the right to vote. You’re an American citizen.”

Voting is more than a political act to Beckwith, and she hopes the community finds that too.

After working the polls for 10 years, she says she’s learned to recognize some names and faces and often catches up with residents. Between herself, her grandmother, godmother, mother, and niece working the polls and the strong relationships they’ve all developed with consistent voters, Beckwith said she considers her polling place very “family-oriented” and wants it to stay that way.

“People do come in to see us and we try to encourage them to bring their people,” she says. <i>—Makenzie Christman, the News Lab @ Penn State for Spotlight PA</i>

## Supporting candidates backed by Trump

<i>2:15 p.m.</i>

Robert Treat, 57, is a Republican who lives on the western end of Cumberland County. Far from the denser suburban towns on the eastern side — which have helped make the county the fastest growing in Pennsylvania — his newly adopted town of Newville reminds him of “the old way of life.”

“Work hard, go to church, know your neighbors,” said Treat, who two years ago moved to this small town of just under 1,400 residents sandwiched between rolling hills and farmland. “We stand up for each other here.”

Preserving that way of life is paramount for Treat, who believes people have gotten away from fundamental American values, chief among them, being independent, working hard to provide for oneself and a family, and passing those values on to the next generation.

Treat, who owns a tattoo shop in Harrisburg, likes to talk. He talks to his clients, who call him “Red Beard,” because of how he’s colored his facial hair. He knows not everyone will agree with him, but he said it’s important that people engage.

He thinks it’s key for American politicians to refocus their efforts on problems facing the United States, and less time trying to fix those in other countries. Fix the border with Mexico. Stop relying on foreign oil.

He doesn’t like it when people feel entitled, or spend years accepting “handouts” from the government.

And he doesn’t care what color you are, what religion you believe in, or who you love, as long as you aren’t hurting anyone. And as long as you are standing, he said, “on your own two feet.”

“You have to get your hustle on,” he said. “Hard. Damn. Work.”

Treat voted for former President Donald Trump both times he ran — and will vote for him again if he decides to run in 2024. Treat will also vote for candidates the former president supports.

It was among the reasons he voted Tuesday for Republicans in the state’s two marquee races: Mehmet Oz, who is running for U.S. Senate, and state Sen. Doug Mastriano, running for governor.

But, he noted, his vote for Oz was really a vote for “the lesser of two evils.”

“I really don’t like either one of them,” he said of Oz, and his Democratic opponent, Lt. Gov. John Fetterman.

He also chose Mastriano for governor over Democrat Josh Shapiro. Abortion — and Mastriano’s opposition to it — was key in that decision. Life, he said, should be the winner in that argument.

But above all, hanging on to the “American way of life” should be the priority.

“I don’t want the life I grew up with to fade away,” he said, “and I will fight to the last breath to defend my way of life.” <i>—Angela Couloumbis, Spotlight PA</i>

## What’s motivating voters in one Philadelphia suburb

<i>1:11 p.m.</i>

The sun beamed on a clear day in Chester County, a reliably Democratic suburb of Philadelphia.

Contending with both the strong sun and crisp breeze, voters dressed in winter coats and flip-flops alike approached the Phoenixville Public Library to cast votes in person or use the drop box parked out front.

Phoenixville, a former iron town that’s rebounded in recent years, is a dark blue dot among

County’s more moderate exurbs. Voters this year will cast ballots in a closely watched legislative race between Republican state Rep. Tim Hennessey, who has served in the legislature for 30 years, and small business owner Paul Friel, a Democrat whose populist ad campaigns have targeted the district’s moderate voters.

Jen Schaefer, 32, voted for Friel as well as every other Democrat on the ballot, she said.

“It’s important,” she said. “I’m concerned about women’s rights, educational issues.”

Schaefer, a mother of two who has lived in town for five years, chose to vote via drop box, something she and her family started doing during the pandemic.

Three Chester County employees in bright orange vests stood sentry over the red, white, and blue drop box and reminded voters to sign and date their ballots. A white camera mounted on top of the box also watched the voters.

As Schaefer walked away, the county workers handed her a yellow slip of paper outlining the rules for using the drop box and the consequences of breaking them: “Failure to comply with the official rules can result in a referral to the District Attorney’s Office.”

Directly down Main Street, behind the First Presbyterian Church, Mark and Rosalind Zaczkiewicz cast their ballots in person.

“We always vote, but the biggest issue this year is the economy,” said Mark, 52.

“For me, it’s voter rights,” said Rosalind, 56, who along with her husband voted for all Democrats.

So did Otis Jones, 64, who has lived in Phoenixville for five years.

“You need to vote,” he said. “You need to have your voice heard. I’m here to make sure the people get what they want.”

Jones said he mostly voted Democrat because “they’re looking out for the people.”

“Republicans say they are but,” Jones trailed off. He shrugged and walked back toward Main Street. <i>—Danielle Ohl, Spotlight PA</i>

## ‘Everything the Republicans are talking about, I don’t like’

<i>1:10 p.m.</i>

Charles Barry Cox, 68 of Carmichaels in Greene County, says he voted for Democrats today.

“I can tell you who I voted for. I’m not ashamed,” he said.

He voted for gubernatorial candidate Josh Shapiro, U.S. Senate nominee John Fetterman, and state House hopeful Doug Mason. He says Bud Cook, elected in November 2016 to serve the people of the 49th District, has nothing to show for all of his years in office. “He’s never brought any legislation to the board,” Cox said.

Cox doesn’t agree with any of the changes the Republican Party is aiming to implement to abortion access, Social Security, and Medicare, though he thinks abortion should only be accessible under certain circumstances.

“I believe, not in abortion, but — when there is rape, incest, a mother’s life, you have to,” he said.

Cox said he can see Greene County shifting from Democratic to Republican. Everyone just listens to what is on TV, he said.

“This country is going to hell if it goes all red,” he said. <i>—Valeria Quinones of the News Lab @ Penn State for Spotlight PA</i>

{{<picture src="external/0rzh2fgkw3kc1fq9ggb2det3xc.jpeg" description="William Allen senior Liliana Delgado, of Allentown, opens and sorts mail-in ballots Nov. 8, 2022, at Lehigh County Government Center in Allentown, Lehigh County, Pennsylvania.

## The room where it happens (in Lehigh County)

<i>1:05 p.m.</i>

On a typical Tuesday, Liliana Delgado can be found at William Allen High School where she’s a senior. But today, Delgado was on the bottom floor of the Lehigh County Government Center sorting through ballots.

Delgado was one of the dozens of students who volunteered to become poll workers or ballot counters for the election.

Her job is to take the ballots out of their envelopes. She described seeing each person’s vote in her own hands as “cool.” Alex Sierra, an employee of the Government Center, came to Delgado’s school as a part of an outreach program to get students involved in their election process and local government.

“[Sierra] was talking about when people think about voting, they think about older people,” Delgado said. “But we want them to think about younger people and look to the future.”

Delgado, who will be joining the Marines Corps at the end of her senior year, said the experience has only deepened her interest in the election process.

{{<picture src="external/2f5b046zk023e515myevh22zf0.jpeg" description="Mail-in ballots are sorted and counted Nov. 8, 2022, at Lehigh County Government Center in Allentown, Lehigh County, Pennsylvania. " caption="Mail-in ballots are sorted and counted Nov. 8, 2022, at Lehigh County Government Center in Allentown, Lehigh County, Pennsylvania. " credit="Matt Smith / For Spotlight PA">}} 

Working alongside Delgado is Tim Benyo, Lehigh County’s election director. Though the latest directives for mail ballots came just days before Nov. 8, county election directors across the state have been preparing for months, and anticipated changes at the eleventh hour.

“For us, it’s just more work to be last-minute and to have a whole new process added,” said Benyo. “We prepare for months and to have a change at the last minute, it invites errors.”

Just a few weeks before the election, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ordered election administrators to hold back on counting mail ballots that are undated or misdated and separate them. The high court also issued guidance as to what counted as an incorrectly dated mail ballot only days before the election.

Benyo said the policy changes resulted in more voters coming in to fix ballots errors. This limits the amount of space available for ballot counters to work. Luckily, the county was able to purchase an electronic ballot sorter that cuts down on time.

Alongside the workers, there were also eight observers in the ballot-counting room. They represented different candidates and parties: GOP nominees Doug Mastriano and Mehmet Oz, Democratic U.S. Rep. Susan Wild, and the local Republican and Democratic parties.

Drummond Taylor of the Pennsylvania Democratic Party said he arrived at 6:45 a.m. and expects to stay until all the ballots are counted. He’s been serving as a liaison between county election officials and volunteers located at polling places.

“I’ve got nothing but faith,” said Taylor about the ballot-processing mechanisms. <i>—Kate Huangpu, Spotlight PA</i>

## A lifetime of tradition in Greene County

<i>12:48 p.m.</i>

A longtime member of the United Methodist women’s organization, Carol Modrick hosts the annual Election Day dinner for adults and children in Carmichaels, Greene County

Modrick has attended and volunteered to help organize the dinner — with the same menu every year — since the 1950s. She remembers her first dinner well; she baked her first pie for the event.

“I would call it a service to the community,” said Modrick, 82, who cast her vote before joining the other volunteers.

She said every woman in the organization has made it a tradition to go out and vote and then volunteer to work the dinner. The dinner this year is across the street from her polling place, which had been moved to the rear of the local florist shop.

Modrick said she has concerns about mail ballots, recalling an earlier incident during the COVID-19 pandemic when her son didn’t receive a check she had mailed him.

She voted by mail once while traveling, but she doesn’t want to do it again and said no one should unless they truly have no other choice.

“I would have to be desperate to do that,” she said.

With the retirement of longtime Democratic state Rep. Pam Snyder, Modrick said she is looking for honesty in the official who replaces her.

“I am so tired of not being able to trust our politicians,” Modrick said. “But we pray for them anyhow. We pray for them all…We pray for our leaders.” <i>—Valeria Quinones of the News Lab @ Penn State for Spotlight PA</i>

## Voters guided by faith in Dauphin County

<i>12:32 p.m.</i>

While Harrisburg and its expanding suburbs define the southern half of Dauphin County, another world lies north of Blue Mountain.

Tucked into valleys between mountain ridges, the area hosts grazing farm animals and rolling fields. Red barns display “Jesus Loves You” in white letters, while roadside signs advertise bottomless election night pork and sauerkraut.

Faith is important to many of the voters in these rural, Republican precincts, such as Rodney Maus, a 62-year-old retired Teamster.

He came to vote in Halifax decked out head to toe in camo, and said his faith guided his votes for GOP candidates. Maus, who studies the Bible privately, said the state’s education system is “smash broke.”

“I’m interested in reading, writing, and arithmetic,” Maus said. “We’ll leave the other stuff up to parents, God, and the Bible.”

A judge of elections said turnout was high in the precinct. Up the road in Elizabethville, a small borough with one polling place in a Lutheran church, turnout was a bit slower as of midday.

Voters here didn’t uniformly cite their faith for their electoral decisions.

Kevin Pringle, a 44-year-old customer service worker and transplant from Alaska, said he voted for a straight Republican ticket out of concerns about the economy and crime.

However, he hopes that the country can become less divided in the future.

“There’s been so much division,” Pringle said, “and the media has been feeding those flames.” <i>—Stephen Caruso, Spotlight PA</i>

## Voting for the ‘lesser of evils’ in Carlisle

<i>12:30 p.m.</i>

When Carlisle resident Johnna Palm first registered to vote in the early 1990s, she said “the level of vitriol and meanness had not infected the political system as it has now.”

These days, Palm, 57, a registered independent, said she spends more time voting against someone than for a particular candidate.

Though she did not disclose who she voted for as she emerged from her polling place about a mile from Carlisle’s quaint downtown strip, she said hers was “definitely a ballot cast for the lesser of evils.”

And that, said Palm, a non-profit grant writer, is what voting has become to her: “choosing the lesser of two evils.”

She recoils against today’s extremism and laments that moderation — on both sides of the political aisle — is a rarity.

Among the issues that drove her to the polls this year was abortion. She doesn’t believe in it, she said, but she also doesn’t believe it should be legislated.

“The legality does not change the existence of abortion, just its safety,” said Palm. “Abortion has existed as long as there have been unexpected, unplanned, or unwanted pregnancies — and those existed before the law.”

She added: “I’m still waiting for the day they tell me women can’t vote.”

Asked about the U.S. Senate race, she spoke generally at first, saying she does not appreciate when a candidate changes residence for political reasons (Mehmet Oz, the Republican running for U.S. Senate, only recently bought a house in Pennsylvania after living in New Jersey for years, which quickly became an issue in the campaign).

“I don’t care which party you’re in, if you aren’t a resident, you can’t represent me,” said Palm. “That was the point of the Revolution.”

Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, the Democrat running against Oz, on the other hand, is a committed Pennsylvanian — but she questions his level of experience for the job. She also believes he has a tendency to work outside the system, which can ultimately work against a candidate.

“Games have rules, including government,” she said. <i>—Angela Couloumbis, Spotlight PA</i>

## Support for women drives Pittsburgh voter to the polls

<i>12:25 p.m.</i>

Yvonne Luckey, 54, has been a poll worker at the YWCA in Homewood for 12 years. She initially did it just to get out of the house, but she enjoys being involved in politics.

Luckey’s morning shift saw sparse turnout, but she expects things to pick up toward the early afternoon.

While working, Luckey wore her La’Tasha Mayes pins. Mayes is the Democratic nominee for Pennsylvania’s 24th state House District.

“I’m all about women in power,” Luckey said. “Women of color, women not of color.”

Luckey considers abortion a lead issue, and notes that she especially disagrees with Republican candidate Mehmet Oz, who has likened it to murder.

“If a child gets raped or molested and they get pregnant, yeah you’re going to abort it,” Luckey said. “You should have that right to abort it. <i>— Abigail Chachoute, the News Lab @ Penn State for Spotlight PA</i>

## Greene County couple casts final votes in Pa.

<i>12:23 p.m.</i>

For the last time before moving out of state, Arthur and Rebekah Giusti cast their votes in the back of Magic Moments, a florist in Carmichaels.

The Giustis, who have lived in the small Greene County town for eight years, plan on moving to Michigan. The local economy, they both said, is “one of the biggest factors” for their departure.

“We’re just not happy,” Rebekah said. “Even if there is progress, it’s not going to happen overnight.”

Arthur said he votes every year and voted for former President Donald Trump twice. In the U.S. Senate race between Democrat John Fetterman and Republican Mehmet Oz, the Giustis made clear their support of the latter candidate.

“Just hoping that Oz comes in and we have a whole shift in the environment in the Senate,” Rebekah said.

However, neither believe either candidate can erase the ongoing drug epidemic gripping Carmichaels. According to the Drug Enforcement Administration, Greene County experienced 46 drug overdose deaths between 2015 and 2017. Pennsylvania saw a 19.1% increase in overdose deaths in 2020, the CDC said. And, last year, according to Attorney General Josh Shapiro’s office, 5,168 Pennsylvanians died from overdoses.

Greene County holds a reputation of being a poor region with an economy “worse than most places,” according to Arthur. “I don’t know if Oz or Fetterman or any of them could change the mentality of this county and the mentality is that if you’re not working, then you do drugs.”

Rebekah added that residents with that mentality rely on the system and get more benefits than middle-class workers but she lacks consistent work opportunities in the small town she’s called home for most of her life.

A licensed practical nurse and a former United States Postal Service employee, Rebekah said the pair shouldn’t be struggling to get by in a place like Carmichaels, but that’s been their reality for the last eight years.

A Pittsburgh native, Arthur worked for 41 years in the railroad industry because of the good retirement plan, but he doesn’t see the area he currently resides in changing rapidly.

“I pay more in health care than most of them pay in rent,” Arthur said. “I want out of here.”

As for the future, Rebekah looks forward to returning to Michigan, where she lived for over 20 years before returning to her hometown. She believes there will be more job opportunities as well as an increase in shopping locations with a lower cost of living.

Arthur looks forward to fishing on Lake Erie and shared the same excitement as his wife for job opportunities. <i>—Alexis Yoder, the News Lab @ Penn State for Spotlight PA</i>

## A slower count expected in Philadelphia

<i>12:15 p.m.</i>

A last-minute change to Philadelphia’s vote-counting plan means that Pennsylvania’s largest, most heavily Democratic county will take longer than it originally anticipated to finish tabulating ballots.

Philadelphia officials had initially projected that they would be mostly finished counting ballots by Wednesday morning. It was an important prediction. The incorrect idea that a slow vote count means something nefarious is going on is common in right-wing political circles and is frequently <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2022/11/2022-pa-election-misinformation-unverified-ballots-drop-boxes-vote-delays/">used to cast doubt on election results</a> in places like Philly.

But now, some tens of thousands of mail ballots still left to count on Tuesday night will need to be counted more slowly through the week, <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/philadelphia-election-vote-count-slowed-poll-book-reconciliation-20221108.html">according to The Inquirer</a>.

That’s not a sign that anything is wrong with the count — just that election workers are conducting an extra, time-consuming check for double votes.

That check is known as poll book reconciliation — a process by which poll workers scan poll book pages into the state’s voter registry to check in-person votes against mail votes. All counties do this eventually, but for the past few years, Philadelphia has been one of the only counties to conduct the check during its initial vote count.

This allowed it to catch double votes that may have slipped through the initial checks that all polling places are required to conduct to make sure nobody votes twice.

Philadelphia’s commissioners had decided to forego that process this year for several reasons. It’s time-consuming, there were no double votes caught by the process in the last three elections, other counties don’t do it, and it involves pausing the count, which commissioners worried could violate a new election law that requires counties to tabulate ballots continuously.

But a conservative group called RITE — Restoring Integrity and Trust in Elections — sued the commissioners, arguing poll book reconciliation is necessary. The case went to Philadelphia Common Pleas Court, where a judge ruled that it was too close to the election for the commissioners to change their process, but that they were wrong to get rid of poll book reconciliation. RITE appealed the case to Commonwealth Court.

The morning of Election Day, commissioners backtracked, saying they were reinstating poll book reconciliation because, as GOP City Commissioner Seth Bluestein said, “while we technically won the court case, the decision was written in such a way that we have no choice but to reinstate the process.”

Bluestein added that he wants to “make it very clear” that “when there are conversations that occur later this evening about whether or not Philadelphia has counted all of their ballots, that the reason that some of the ballots will not be counted is that Republican attorneys targeted Philadelphia, and only Philadelphia, and tried to force us to do a procedure that no other county does.”

Shortly after the commissioners announced their decision, RITE issued a statement apparently responding to Bluestein, saying that “if there are delays, only the Commissioners are to blame.” <i>—Katie Meyer, Spotlight PA</i>

## A frustrating voting experience in Erie

<i>12:10 p.m.</i>

For years, James Gates and his friend went through the same back door into Second Baptist Church in southeast Erie. When Gates and his friend arrived today, that door was locked, with no signage or any indication that showed voting was taking place in the building.

Gate’s friend was about to leave. He stopped his friend, who refused to be identified, and waited in the parking lot until they saw someone walking into another door, adjacent to the front of the parking lot. There was only a small poster with a black arrow and a yellow background on the side of the “right door.”

“There’s something going on with the voting authority,” Gates said.

To them, the voting location, too, was confusing and frustrating. Their polling location has changed several times in the past few years.

“I missed a year of voting because I went to the school and there was nothing, and nobody tells me that I had come here to this church,” he said. “It’s getting to be really questionable as to whether or not there’s any honesty or integrity involved with voting in Pennsylvania.”

However, Gates, 58, who said he is a disabled veteran and a registered Republican, said he will believe in the election outcome.

“I did ten years in the military, and I learned you have to accept the outcome, you know, and believe that our system will work if it’s allowed to,” he said.

Gate’s friend hopped back into his car to drive back to his office to print a sign, hoping to inform future voters of the right location to vote.

Right before Gates left, a sign that says, “Please note: voting located parking lot front entrance door” was added to the gate. <i>—Alicia Chiang, the NewsLab @ Penn State for Spotlight PA</i>

## Voters say crime, abortion, trust in voting systems motivated them

<i>11:51 a.m.</i>

Standing outside the back door of the Helen S. Faison Arts Academy gym in Homewood in Pittsburgh, Keith McBroom said Election Day has been “a little slow, but it’s still early.”

“Presidential elections, however, are phenomenal,” McBroom said. “People come out for those.”

McBroom — who was wearing a yellow beanie, lanyard, and nametag reading “Judge of Elections”— has held his position for 20 years. Judges of elections are typically in charge of a polling place; they keep track of votes throughout the day and deliver results to the county office after the location closes.

McBroom, who recently spent 19 days in the hospital, said mail ballots have historically been a good alternative for voters who are incapacitated.

A Democrat, McBroom paused when asked if he has ever crossed party lines.

“Sometimes,” he said.

On their way into the Homewood-Brushton YWCA, Christopher Trowery and Stephanie Clemm said they decided to vote in person because they had doubts about mail voting.

“Yesterday, I read that 1,000 people in Allegheny County — their vote didn’t count, so they had to run down there and fix it because the dates were wrong,” Clemm said. “I just don’t trust it.”

The state Supreme Court recently ruled that undated and incorrectly dated mail ballots should not be counted. Allegheny County <a href="https://www.alleghenycounty.us/elections/incorrect,-no-date-ballots.aspx">published a list of voters whose ballots had fatal defects</a> to give them a chance to fix them.

Trowery, pulling on a cigarette, said crime was his biggest motivating issue. Clemm said she was voting “to keep the Republicans out.”

Poll worker Irene Bejide’s main political concerns were summed up in one word: “Everything,” she said, walking briskly past. <i>—Lilly Riddle, the News Lab @ Penn State for Spotlight PA</i>

## A new voter comes out for the U.S. Senate race

<i>11:48 a.m.</i>

Tuesday marked the first general election in which 18-year-old Grant Deshishku has voted.

The registered Democrat and Dickinson College student in Carlisle is coming of voting age in what he instinctively knows are polarizing times, when election decisions are not just about the candidates but about issues critical to the future of the country.

For Deshishku, abortion rights is one of those issues — he believes pregnant people should have the right to choose whether to continue a pregnancy. It is among the many reasons he voted for Lt. Gov. John Fetterman for U.S. Senate, he said.

“I’m really here for the U.S. Senate race,” he said, adding that he attended a Fetterman rally in Carlisle last week.

He wishes the campaign had been more about policy, and said he was turned off by ads aired in particular by Republican U.S. Senate candidate Mehmet Oz.

“The buzzword strategy and alliterations they use — like ‘far-left fraud’ — I really don’t appreciate it,” he said. “It’s not about policy anymore.”

Though he is a Democrat, and supports progressive candidates, he said he’d be willing to split his ticket and vote for a Republican.

One Republican he says he can’t support is former President Donald Trump, whose politics he believes have exacerbated divisions in the country.

Despite Trump’s unfounded claims of rigged elections and unchecked fraud, Deshishku believes in the power of voting, and has enjoyed the process of casting ballots in person.

“It’s the most power we have as citizens,” he said. <i>—Angela Couloumbis, Spotlight PA</i>

## An Erie resident faces accessibility issues in more ways than one

<i>11:30 a.m.</i>

Getting around southeast Erie isn’t easy these days for Paula Best. Best, 68, has back and knee issues. She arrived at the Second Baptist Church, her polling place, with the help of a cane.

Best always votes in person and said voting by mail wasn’t an option for her — she can’t bend down far enough to reach the mail that slides through her door’s mail slot.

Her polling place also changed which doors voters enter through, which made things harder. Last year’s entrance allowed her to walk up a flat surface with her cane, while this year’s entrance had a set of stairs.

Voting is important to Best, so she made the trip up the stairs anyway and informed others of the change of doors on her way out.

Physical accessibility isn’t the only hurdle Best faced. She said she doesn’t go out often because her neighborhood of 30 years has “gone down a lot.”

“There’s a lot of drugs and there’s a lot of crime,” she said. “And then there’s landlords that don’t take care of their properties around here. They’re just out for the money, they don’t care. And they don’t care about the people that do care around here.”

Best said she doesn’t expect politicians to take an interest in changing southeast Erie anytime soon. Rather, she cast her vote for the same reason she has in years past — for women’s rights.

“I think that women should be allowed to do her own thing — her body and everything,” Best said. <i>—Makenzie Christman, the News Lab @ Penn State for Spotlight PA</i>

{{<picture src="external/s7www6bdsntpatvqwedsnzryfc.jpeg" description="For DonnaMarie Yeager, crime was the most important issue. S" caption="For DonnaMarie Yeager, crime was the most important issue. S" credit="Matt Smith / For Spotlight PA">}} 

## What’s important to Allentown voters

<i>11 a.m.</i>

Before beginning their workdays, voters in Allentown went to their local library to cast their ballots.

For DonnaMarie Yeager, crime was the most important issue. She voted for Democratic U.S. Senate candidate John Fetterman and criticized Republican Mehmet Oz’s attacks on his health.

“I had a stroke. He had a stroke. It’s not easy to recover,” said Yeager.

Other voters were more concerned about the number of election deniers on their ballots. Bill McGlinn, the interim executive director of the Bradbury-Sullivan LGBT Community Center, said that his main litmus test when choosing a candidate was whether they perpetuated false claims of election fraud.

“We have a country that’s being taken over by false prophets,” said McGlinn. “It’s become the normative piece of our political discourse — denial of truth. We’re in really serious trouble.”

McGlinn said he’s voted for candidates from both major parties in the past. He pointed to state Sen. Pat Browne (R., Lehigh) as an example of a Republican legislator who lobbied for Allentown but was rejected by his party for views that weren’t radical enough.

{{<picture src="external/531mmxv7djzzx5wy5vmmgam76w.jpeg" description="Stacey Klokocs regularly splits her ticket, but her primary concern is reducing taxes on the working class and limiting government spending." caption="Stacey Klokocs regularly splits her ticket, but her primary concern is reducing taxes on the working class and limiting government spending." credit="Matt Smith / For Spotlight PA">}} 

In the primary, Browne — who has been in his seat since 2005 — was defeated by newcomer Jarrett Coleman, an airline pilot and recently elected member of the Parkland School Board. Coleman, who beat Browne by only 24 votes, said his platform includes cutting government spending, repealing no-excuse mail ballots, and passing a gift ban for elected officials.

Mark Pinsley, the Democratic candidate for the state Senate seat and Lehigh County’s controller, has listed increasing the minimum wage, ending mass incarceration, and lowering health care costs as priorities.

Stacey Klokocs also regularly splits her ticket, but her primary concern is reducing taxes on the working class and limiting government spending. Klokocs says she’s been working since she was 12 and is concerned about the rising costs of living. She said she looks at “how [candidates] feel about the working class person.”

Klokocs said she cast her ballot in person this year because she feels she has more control. She was worried her ballot might get lost in the mail and wasn’t sure a ballot would come in time.

“For me, it’s all about being involved,” said Klokocs. “My mail only comes once a week, and I was worried was my vote wasn’t going to come in in time.” <i>—Kate Huangpu, Spotlight PA</i>

## <b>One Erie resident wants solutions to inflation</b>

<i>10:45 a.m.</i>

Paul Thelen doesn’t trust anyone when it comes to elections.

Over the past several years, Thelen, a disabled resident of Erie, found his Social Security income check stretching thinner and thinner. Now, Thelen says, almost half of it goes towards filling the gas tank in his “pig” of a pickup truck, and the rest toward home repairs and groceries for a family of three.

Thelen lives just a few blocks away from General Teamsters Union Local 397 — where he voted Tuesday — and finds most of his gas goes toward driving his daughter around and visiting family on the west side of town.

“Going to Millcreek is a quarter of a tank,” he said.

Saying only he voted Republican, Thelen hopes to put someone in office who will offer solutions to inflation and strengthen border security. His family hasn’t voted Democrat since John F. Kennedy was in office.

Thelen says he can’t trust anyone, not even the machine counting ballots inside the polling place.

“For all I know, it could be turning my vote Democrat in there,” Thelen said.

## The mail ballot count continues

<i>10:45 a.m.</i>

Across Pennsylvania, more than 1.4 million people requested to vote by mail. As of Nov. 7, 1.16 million absentee and mail ballots had been returned, according to Department of State data.

Before Election Day, some of the state’s largest counties said <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2022/11/pa-election-2022-mail-ballot-requests-data-counting-delays/" target="_blank">it would likely take until Wednesday to finish counting absentee and mail ballots.</a>

In Lancaster County, where more than 41,000 mail and absentee ballots were received as of Monday, officials expect to finish the count by midnight.

Elections director Christa Miller said roughly 25% of those ballots had been opened. As of 10 a.m., approximately 300 voters had dropped off mail ballots Tuesday at the election office as they may do until 8 p.m.

Per an order from the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, the county is not counting but is setting aside undated and incorrectly dated ballots. Miller did not have an estimate of how many of those ballots the county had received. <i>—Carter Walker, Votebeat / Spotlight PA and Sarah Anne Hughes, Spotlight PA</i>

## ‘Women belong in all places that decisions are being made’

<i>10:10 a.m.</i>

In Erie’s shivering morning cold, Jasmine Flores, 29, walked out of the Teamster Union Local 397 building after she voted.

“I have to work all day, and I have study sessions for the City Council business, so I had to come and do it early, first thing in the morning, to get it done,” Flores said.

A lifelong Erie resident and a member of the Democratic Party, Flores has been involved in community organizations and activism since 2018. She was elected to Erie’s City Council in January 2022.

Flores said the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade motivated her to vote.

“Women belong in all places that decisions are being made. So I had to show up for my sisters who need the ability and access to abortion if they have to have it,” Flores said.

Half Mexican and half Puerto Rican, Flores wants her community members to be informed about the election.

“Being informed on the candidates who are going to be making decisions that impact our lives is really important to me and making sure my community is aware of that,” said Flores. <i>—Alicia Chiang, the News Lab @ Penn State for Spotlight PA</i>

## Motivated by opposition, not support, in Cumberland County

<i>10 a.m.</i>

Joe Neville is a loyal voter because, as he put it Tuesday shortly after the polls opened in Mechanicsburg, Cumberland County, “if I don’t vote, I can’t complain.”

The 61-year-old retired state worker said he was motivated to come to the polls this year more by candidates and issues he opposes, rather than supports.

Though he would not reveal his ballot choices, he said he believes Republican nominee for governor Doug Mastriano has expressed “extreme views.” He also said he wasn’t sure what to think of Mehmet Oz’s candidacy for U.S. Senate.

“I have concerns about John Fetterman, but at least he seems like a decent man,” Neville, a registered Republican, said of the Democratic candidate.

Neville said he is not a voter who votes straight party line, and instead frequently splits his ballot. This year was no exception, he said.

Though he makes it a point to stay informed, the sheer volume of campaign literature and political news has been exhausting.

This morning, he said, as he was getting dressed to come to the polls to vote, he had CNN on.

“I said to my wife, I’m sick of this already,” said Neville. <i>—Angela Couloumbis, Spotlight PA</i>

## A Pittsburgh voter fears losing her rights

<i>9:55 a.m.</i>

In a winter coat with pins for Democratic candidates John Fetterman and Josh Shapiro, Anna Fisher, 45, an associate professor at Carnegie Mellon, stood outside the Jewish Community Center on Tuesday morning, thanking people for voting and handing out envelopes.

Born in Ukraine and raised in Russia, Fisher formerly lived in the Soviet Union, where she only got the opportunity to vote in only one free and fair election.

“I really hope that we do not lose the right to vote,” Fisher said.”A lot of people who are running supported the insurrection or they have insurrectionists on their campaign staff, and I really would like to protect democracy, not only to protect the rights we already have but also expand the rights too.”

Fisher realized how many barriers exist for people to exercise their right to vote when doing voter registration for the first time this year.

Working at CMU, Fisher said students who have moved from different dorms and apartments had to change their voter registration address multiple times. She saw how confusing it can get.

“For young people, this is oftentimes their first election and they move to different states, so it can get very confusing how to access and exercise their right to vote,” Fisher said.

Along with issues about access, Fisher had concerns about voter intimidation and mail ballots being thrown out because of simple mistakes. As a mother, she wants her two daughters to have the right to choose.

“Democracy and reproductive rights are my two reasons,” Fisher said. <i>— Abigail Chachoute, the News Lab @ Penn State for Spotlight PA</i>

## A Mechanicsburg voter who wants to ‘turn this country around’

<i>9:50 a.m.</i>

Bill Nailor came out early to vote Tuesday because, as he put it, he’s “disgusted with the federal government,” and thinks President Joe Biden is an “idiot.”

The 74-year-old self-described conservative TV junkie lives in Cumberland County in central Pennsylvania and said he voted for GOP candidates down the ballot.

“Anything I can do to turn this country around,” said Nailor, a registered Republican.

A one-time small business owner, Nailor said he voted for Donald Trump both in 2016 and 2020, and believes the last presidential election was stolen. He also believes there is fraud in elections, including this one, though experts have said repeatedly there is no evidence of widespread election fraud.

“The cheating has already begun for sure,” he said as he exited a polling place just off the main street of downtown Mechanicsburg.

A key issue that motivated him to come to the polls: immigration and securing the U.S. border.

He said he never considered voting for Democratic U.S. Senate candidate John Fetterman, who he believes was incapacitated by a stroke (<a href="https://apnews.com/article/mehmet-oz-2022-midterm-elections-health-business-stroke-cd5e3188b74933566ba5a8f95b2c426f">Fetterman’s doctors say he is recovering well</a>).

“I’m not big on carpetbagging Oz, but feel he will give us fair representation,” said Nailor of Republican candidate Mehmet Oz.

He said he likes state Sen. Doug Mastriano, the Republican candidate for governor, but is enough of a realist to know that it is unlikely the lawmaker will win. He voted for Mastriano anyway, he said.

Nailor said he never considered voting by mail, because he doesn’t trust the system. Plus, he said, he’s always voted in person: “I’m 74 years old, that’s what you do.” <i>—Angela Couloumbis, Spotlight PA</i>

## ‘Are you aware of the fake Mike Doyle on your ballot today?’

<i>9:45 a.m.</i>

The sun had barely begun to gild the treetops in Squirrel Hill as voters filed into the Jewish Community Center of Greater Pittsburgh to cast their ballots.

Yael Silk, 43, wearing a T-shirt that read “Jews for Summer Lee,” greeted and directed people as they walked into their polling station.

“Are you aware of the fake Mike Doyle on your ballot today?” Silk, an executive director, asked a couple walking by. She was referencing the Republican candidate for the 12th Congressional District, who has the same name as the retiring Democratic incumbent.

“Having to defend against name trickery is not something that I thought we would be needing to do today,” Silk said. She said Summer Lee, the Democratic candidate, will stand for women’s rights and a “multi-racial democracy.”

“Part of my Jewish identity means I know what it’s like to feel under threat for who we are, and no one should feel that way,” she added.

Mark Roberts, 67, votes in every election and prefers to do it in person.

“I’m really worried about the state of our democracy and the incredible rise of people who don’t care about science and the facts and that sort of stuff,” he said.

Andrew Thompson, 22, said it would be “a crime” not to vote, since he lives a five-minute walk away.

“I think a lot of the Democratic candidates, personally, have a lot more empathy,” the recent graduate said. “But whatever happens, happens.” <i>— Lilly Riddle, the News Lab @ Penn State for Spotlight PA</i>

## Lifelong Greene County resident cites abortion, need for jobs as reasons to vote

<i>9:37 a.m.</i>

Rosemarie Morehead, a lifelong Greene County resident, said Tuesday morning that her area is sometimes “forgotten.”

Morehead, 54, works at Blueprints, a social services agency that serves 20,000 residents of Greene and Washington Counties as well as West Virginia with 50 programs that address home, financial, and mental health needs. She hopes the redistricting of her state House district helps bring change to the area, which she says needs new jobs and an updated transportation system.

She lives in District 50, which now includes all of Greene County and part of Washington County. Republican candidate and incumbent Bud Cook is facing Democrat Doug Mason.

Through her work in social services, Morehead knows how important bringing new jobs to the area is to decrease the poverty rate.

Morehead, who voted at a polling place in Waynesburg, noted the town’s location off of Interstate 79 as a prime location for an industrial park to bring new jobs to the area.

“We could have used Amazon when nobody wanted it,” Morehead said.

She also said the overturning of Roe v. Wade was an important issue that motivated her to vote because she never thought she’d see it be reversed in her lifetime.

“It’s just unbelievable to me,” Morehead said. “As a woman, I think it’s important for us to vote regardless of what it is.” <i>—Alexis Yoder, the News Lab @ Penn State for Spotlight PA</i>

## A split-ticket voter cites economy, abortion as top issues

<i>9:32 a.m.</i>

Julia Broskey, 37, has lived in the southwest corner of Pennsylvania for less than two years. She hails from Pittsburgh and has lived in multiple states, but makes sure to vote most of the time either in-person or by mail.

She left her polling place in Waynesburg around 7:40 a.m. after she voted for candidates from both major parties (she did not name them). Broskey cited the economy, abortion, and the tight gubernatorial race as issues she kept in mind while voting.

Broskey has worked in higher education for her entire life and is currently in a three-year stint at West Virginia University. She called President Joe Biden’s plan to forgive student loan debt a “hot-button topic,” one in which she takes the opposing view.

“I don’t think it’s a good idea,” Broskey said. “Having worked in education for a long time, there are a lot of choices people have. I just think it’s taking away from those who are working people. I’m sure it’s not a popular opinion of some people in education, but there’s ways you can pay off your loans.”

Broskey said she considers multiple issues when voting in every election because “one issue can come and go.” <i>—Alexis Yoder, the News Lab @ Penn State for Spotlight PA</i>

## In Harrisburg: ‘I don’t like the election deniers’

<i>9:30 a.m.</i>

A steady stream of voters flowed in and out of the 11th Ward polling place in Midtown Harrisburg Tuesday morning.

For some, voting was a pit stop before dropping a kid off at school or heading to work. For others, such as Karen Chaney, a 65-year-old nurse, voting was their last stop after working a night shift.

Chaney, a registered Democrat, said she voted a straight ticket for the party. Like many others at this urban polling place, her top issue was protecting voting rights.

“I don’t like the election deniers,” she told Spotlight PA. “I feel like that’s dangerous to democracy.”

Near the top of the Republican ticket this year is gubernatorial candidate Doug Mastriano, a state senator who spread false information about voter fraud after the 2020 election and bussed supporters to a Jan. 6, 2021 rally that proceeded the storming of the U.S. Capitol.

Saliyma Chapman, a 29-year-old housing counselor, said she wanted to be sure “sane people who actually care for the state and the country” were in charge — “aka, the Democrats.”

She thought about casting a mail ballot this year, but, “I didn’t want it to get lost in the mail.”

The city of Harrisburg is heavily Democratic — it voted 84-14 for Biden in 2020. But it is home to Republicans, including Warren Harden, a law enforcement officer in his 60s.

Harden said he was motivated to vote by “moral issues” such as abortion, which he opposes. He voted for Mastriano.

However, he also cast a ballot for Democratic state Rep. Patty Kim. He declined to say who he voted for in the U.S. Senate race.

“They are both a little twisted,” he said of Democrat John Fetterman and Republican Mehmet Oz, “so I chose the lesser of the evils.”

As for if he can trust the results, Harden demurred: “Being a Christian, I put that in God’s hands.” <i>—Stephen Caruso, Spotlight PA</i>

## A Greene County voter on the Democratic Party: ‘They’re not one of us’

<i>9:10 a.m.</i>

Born and raised in Greene County — located in Pennsylvania’s southwest corner — Barb Stewart, 78, and her husband Ken, 82, have been Republicans all of their adult lives despite growing up Democrats.

Shortly after the polls opened at 7 a.m. in Waynesburg, Barb said the Democratic Party is no longer what she knew it to be growing up, and the Republican Party now stands more for the issues that matter to her most.

“I will not back a party that supports the killing of innocent children,” said Barb, referring to the Democratic Party’s stance on abortion access.

Abortion, however, is not the primary reason she’s a Republican. She believes the Democratic Party no longer cares about the people and doesn’t agree with its policies.

“They’re not one of us anymore,” she said. <i>—Valeria Quinones, the News Lab @ Penn State for Spotlight PA</i>

## Mail ballot counting going smoothly in Lancaster County after rough primary

<i>8:45 a.m.</i>

Lancaster County’s mail ballot counting operation was humming along smoothly as of 8:30 a.m.

Unlike in the primary — <a href="https://lancasteronline.com/news/politics/more-than-half-of-mail-in-ballots-now-need-hand-counting-due-to-vendors-latest/article_edbf4b44-b804-11eb-83fa-af03599a9d01.html">when poll workers had to remark thousands of ballots by hand due to a printing error</a> — ballots opened today were being run through scanners without issue.

“Everything is scanning, everything is going well,” Elections Director Christa Miller told County Commissioner Ray D’Agostino, chair of the board of elections.

Roughly two dozen volunteers, overseen by county staff and partisan poll watchers, ensured the number of ballots received from a precinct matched what was recorded, opened the outer and inner envelopes with a high-speed slicer, and flattened out ballots for tabulation machines.

D’Agostino could not provide an estimate of the number of ballots counted so far this morning, but said the county planned to count all ballots received before Tuesday, roughly 41,000, today. Ballots received on Election Day will be counted Wednesday.

He said that the requirement to count continuously, a mandate for counties receiving election grants under Act 88, would not be a major issue for the county as it has had experience with counting continuously in the 2020 election. <i>—Carter Walker, </i><a href="https://www.votebeat.org/"><i>Votebeat</i></a><i> / Spotlight PA</i>

## Which Pennsylvania counties are ‘curing’ ballots?

<i>7:55 a.m.</i>

Following a state Supreme Court ruling that found undated or incorrectly dated ballots <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2022/11/pa-election-2022-undated-mail-ballots-supreme-court-decision/">shouldn’t be counted on Nov. 8</a>, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-pittsburgh-pennsylvania-philadelphia-7baedef7e9d8f0466398632f60efe1e8">voters are scrambling to fix the errors</a>, the AP reports.

Under state law, a person who casts a mail ballot must sign and date a declaration on the outer envelope. Undated ballots have a missing date, but are otherwise turned in on time to county election offices.

Incorrectly dated mail ballots were <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/pennsylvania-undated-ballots-supreme-court-wrongly-dated-lawsuit-20221105.html">defined by the high court</a> as those with dates that fall before Sept. 19, 2022, or after Nov. 8, 2022. For absentee ballots, the dates are Aug. 30, 2022, or after Nov. 8, 2022.

Some counties are proactively reaching out to voters about the issues and allowing them to fix their ballots, but others aren’t.

Spotlight PA could not identify a complete list of which of the 67 counties are “curing” ballots and which aren’t. Reporters found that Chester, Clearfield, Lehigh, Montgomery, and Philadelphia are among those curing ballots.

Cumberland County would not answer the question, <a href="https://www.democracydocket.com/news-alerts/republicans-file-lawsuit-challenging-ballot-cure-procedures-in-pennsylvania/" target="_blank">citing ongoing litigation</a>. Centre and Dauphin Counties are not curing ballots.

The state’s top election official said people who think they may have made a mistake should reach out to their county immediately. Even if your county won’t let you fix your mail ballot, you <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/fix-pennsylvania-mail-ballot-mistakes-20221028.html">have a right to vote by provisional ballot today</a>. <i>—Sarah Anne Hughes, Spotlight PA</i>

## Philly commissioners vote to reinstate poll book reconciliation, delaying results

<i>7:27 a.m.</i>

“Philadelphia officials voted Tuesday morning to reinstate a process that can catch possible double votes from being counted — and will also slow down their ability to report midterm election results over the next week.

If Pennsylvania’s high-stakes U.S. Senate race is as close as expected, a wait for results out of the state’s largest city is sure to shine a national spotlight on Philadelphia, similar to after the 2020 presidential election.” <i>— Jonathan Lai and Jeremy Roebuck, The Inquirer</i>

## Shapiro continues to outraise Mastriano in final days of election

<i>7:20 a.m.</i>

In the waning days of the race for Pennsylvania’s top job, Democrat Josh Shapiro and Republican Doug Mastriano have crisscrossed the state to rally supporters and win over undecided voters.

To bolster those efforts, the gubernatorial nominees have collectively raised millions of dollars in eleventh-hour campaign donations to help get their message out.

The candidates reported the donations in campaign finance reports filed daily over the past two weeks, chronicling a trail of last-minute donations.

As he has throughout the campaign, Shapiro has far outraised Mastriano, raking in roughly $2.4 million between Oct. 25 and Nov. 7, to Mastriano’s $475,000, records show.

Shapiro’s biggest donors continue to be political action committees run by national Democratic groups, as well as public and private unions. More than $440,000, for instance, came from the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, which has spent heavily in Pennsylvania to elect a Democrat in another marquee race: that for U.S. Senate.

Shapiro also received $200,000 from Jeffrey Lurie, who owns the Philadelphia Eagles, and $250,000 from billionaire Thomas Hagen, the board chair of Erie Indemnity Company.

In all, Shapiro has raised an eye-popping $65.2 million since the start of 2021 and spent a record $62.2 million. Compare that to Mastriano, who has raised $6.9 million in that same time frame and spent $5.8 million.

The two men have run vastly different campaigns. Shapiro has inundated the airwaves with campaign ads, while Mastriano has largely appealed to a loyal base, unable to front the cash to keep pace in ad spending.

Among Mastriano’s largest donors over the past two weeks: the political action committee affiliated with former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, which contributed $50,000. The PAC run by Mastriano’s running mate, GOP state Rep. Carrie DelRosso, also donated $50,000. <i>—Angela Couloumbis, Spotlight PA</i>
