HARRISBURG — Special elections to fill two seats in the Pennsylvania House vacated by Democrats should be held on Feb. 7, Commonwealth Court has ruled.

Democrats and Republicans have been at odds in recent weeks over which party had the authority to schedule three special elections in the chamber. The outcome of those races will likely determine which party holds the majority in the state House.

In November, Democrats won 102 out of 203 seats in the lower chamber — on paper, a one-vote majority. However, one winning Democrat died shortly before Election Day while two others resigned in December to take higher office.

Together, those three vacancies, all in Allegheny County, left Democrats at a three-vote disadvantage to Republicans.

Before Friday’s ruling, Democrats and Republicans had agreed to hold one of the special elections, to replace late state Rep. Tony DeLuca, on Feb. 7.

“Today’s decision is good news for the nearly 200,000 Allegheny County residents currently without representation in the state House,” a spokesperson for the state House Democratic caucus said in a statement. “Now county elections officials can proceed to print ballots and make final preparations for special elections in the 32nd, 34th, and 35th legislative districts on February 7.”

It was not immediately clear if Republicans would appeal the ruling to the state Supreme Court. Jason Gottesman, a spokesperson for state House Republicans, did not immediately return a call seeking comment.
