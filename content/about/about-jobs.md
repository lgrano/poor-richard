**Summary:** We are seeking an Operations Manager to join our team at Spotlight PA, an award-winning independent newsroom covering Pennsylvania’s Capitol and urgent statewide issues. The mission of Spotlight PA is simple: to hold powerful private and public forces to account by producing nonpartisan journalism that gets results and serves the public good. Spotlight PA has the largest collaborative local journalism network of its kind in the United States, with stories shared across more than 80 partner newsrooms, allowing our vital investigative and public-service reporting to reach Pennsylvanians in all corners.

**What you’ll do:** Get in on the ground floor of a fast-growing news organization that’s been recognized as one of the most promising new models for collaborative local journalism in the United States. Directly reporting to the executive director, the Operations Manager will take the lead in developing operational strategies and executing key special projects vital to the long-term viability and sustainability of Spotlight PA. This vital role, funded in partnership with the American Journalism Project, will enable the continued sustainable growth of our news organization in service to all Pennsylvanians. The Operations Manager will be empowered to identify areas for operational improvements and will be encouraged to suggest new, creative ways Spotlight PA can best support its journalism and the people producing it.

**Who we’re looking for:** The operations manager should have 3-5 years of experience in project, program, or organizational management with specific examples of how their role enabled their organization to improve and grow. The manager should be extremely organized, detail-oriented, and adaptable, with strong communication skills, as this role will touch on projects across the organization. Applicants should be passionate about revitalizing nonpartisan, independent journalism in Pennsylvania and helping a fast-growing organization take the next steps toward long-term organizational stability and success. We welcome applicants with relevant experience in any industry or sector, regardless of their career path.

An ability to work in a collaborative environment is a must. We’re an agile startup that values camaraderie and equity across all of the work that we do, and everyone on our team pitches in across the organization and brings a sense of urgency and drive to their work every day. We also value innovation, creativity, and originality, and we’re always seeking to explore new and experimental ways of doing our work and connecting it with readers across the state.

**This job is full-time and includes benefits. The position is remote, though a home base in Pennsylvania is preferred. This position is budgeted for a salary from $65,000-$75,000, depending on experience. Applicants should include a resume and cover letter explaining past successes and why they’re a good fit for this role.** Please note the application portal is managed by The Philadelphia Inquirer, but your materials will be directed to the Spotlight PA team.

We know not everyone reading this will fit exactly what we’ve described. We encourage everyone to apply who shares our passion for indispensable journalism and our drive to create a sustainable business model to support it. Spotlight PA is committed to fostering a diverse and inclusive culture, and we especially encourage members of underrepresented communities to submit an application, including women, people of color, veterans, LGBTQ+ people, and individuals with disabilities.
