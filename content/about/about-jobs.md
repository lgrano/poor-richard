**Summary:** We are seeking a Newsroom Developer to join our team at Spotlight PA, an award-winning independent newsroom covering Pennsylvania’s Capitol and urgent statewide issues. The mission of Spotlight PA is simple: to hold powerful private and public forces to account by producing journalism that gets results and serves the public good. Spotlight PA has the largest collaborative local journalism network of its kind in the United States, with stories shared across more than 90 partner newsrooms, allowing our journalism to reach Pennsylvanians in all corners. The newsroom is supported by grants and donations from individual and institutional donors who believe in the value of the work and want to sustain it. 

With initial grant funding for one year, we are launching the Democracy Initiative, a novel, nonpartisan project to equip and empower Pennsylvanians to engage with their government, elections, and the voting process. The Democracy Initiative seeks to enhance our growing portfolio of voter-centric election resources, training, events, and general service journalism, and to oversee new and creative ways to connect those resources with communities across the state. A particular focus of the initiative is expanding Spotlight PA’s reach and value among people who do not normally engage with traditional media or who have felt left out or misrepresented by conventional election and government coverage. The purpose of the initiative is to enhance engagement with our democracy, a cornerstone of its preservation, and showcase the direct value Spotlight PA can provide to communities beyond the written word.

**What you’ll do:** As Pennsylvania approaches the critical November election and looks toward the presidential election in 2024, the Newsroom Developer will work closely with the editorial team to develop new products and tools to connect new or existing audiences with voting resources.

In addition to on-site work, this might also include making elements embeddable for partners.
* Work with the editorial team to identify new/emerging areas where Spotlight PA can serve as a direct resource to the public, and develop innovative tools and storytelling techniques to fill the void.

After the election, the Newsroom Developer will continue to work on Democracy Initiative-focused projects in advance of 2024 as well as other newsroom projects. This work might include:

* Creating products that affect change in Pennsylvania.
