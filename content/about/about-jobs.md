## Penn State Investigative Reporter, Spotlight PA State College

## <a href="https://us61e2.dayforcehcm.com/CandidatePortal/en-US/philainquirer/Posting/View/454">Apply Here</a>

**Summary:** We are seeking a passionate reporter to provide vital accountability reporting on Penn State University for Spotlight PA, an award-winning, independent, and nonpartisan newsroom focused on urgent statewide issues. The mission of Spotlight PA is simple: to hold powerful private and public forces to account by producing journalism that gets results and serves the public good. This investigative reporter will be an integral part of Spotlight’s [first local bureau](https://www.spotlightpa.org/statecollege) launching this summer in State College, Pennsylvania.

State College is home to the main campus of Penn State, a $7.7 billion operation that receives more than $300 million in funding from the state government and has an enrollment of 90,000 students. The child sex abuse scandal at Penn State a decade ago — uncovered by a Pa. reporter — only underscored the need for more investigative journalism to hold such a mammoth state institution to account.

**What you’ll do:** This reporter will lead Spotlight PA’s coverage of Penn State. While there may be occasional daily reporting, this position will primarily allow for the reporter to take the time to go beneath the surface to examine the inner workings of the institution.

Since Spotlight PA focuses on accountability reporting, this reporter will be expected to build sources and scrutinize policies through the power players and special interests around them. 

This is an enterprise beat, and the reporter will be expected to regularly uncover and write stories and investigate issues that are otherwise getting little to no attention, supported by an excitable team that is intensely familiar with the state’s bureaucracies.

Spotlight PA partners with more than 80 newsrooms across the state to share stories, and this reporter would frequently collaborate with other journalists in the pursuit of impact-driven reporting.

**Who we’re looking for:** Ideal candidates will have investigative clips that show an ability to report beyond daily news, build a diverse network of sources, and aggressively fight for and use public records. We want someone who can penetrate guarded and closed-off institutions, persistently pitch stories, and keep several projects of varying lengths cooking at one time. The best candidates will bring big ideas and a sense of urgency to work each day, and be eager to work with Spotlight PA’s team of like-minded reporters.

Some other ideal traits, though not essential:

* Knowledge of Pennsylvania and/or sprawling university systems;
* Fluency in foreign languages, particularly Spanish;
* A comfort with requesting, scrutinizing, and using data in the reporting process;

This job is full-time and includes benefits. While we have the flexibility to find a compensation package that will work for the right candidate, this position is budgeted for a salary from $65,000-$75,000, depending on experience.

While you will be part of our State College initiative, this reporter can be based anywhere in Pennsylvania. We can provide a moving stipend if the right candidate is moving to the state. Applicants should include a resume, cover letter, and links to journalism they feel best exemplifies what we’re seeking.

We know not everyone reading this will fit exactly what we’ve described. We encourage everyone to apply who shares our passion for indispensable journalism and our drive to create a sustainable business model to support it. Spotlight PA is committed to fostering a diverse and inclusive culture, and we especially encourage members of underrepresented communities to submit an application, including women, people of color, veterans, LGBTQ+ people, and individuals with disabilities.

## Major Gifts Director, Spotlight PA

## <a href="https://us61e2.dayforcehcm.com/CandidatePortal/en-US/philainquirer/Posting/View/492">Apply Here</a>

**Summary:** We are seeking a Major Gifts Director to join our team at Spotlight PA, an award-winning independent newsroom covering Pennsylvania’s Capitol and urgent statewide issues. The mission of Spotlight PA is simple: to hold powerful private and public forces to account by producing journalism that gets results and serves the public good. Spotlight PA has the largest collaborative local journalism network of its kind in the United States, with stories shared across more than 80 partner newsrooms, allowing our journalism to reach Pennsylvanians in all corners. The newsroom is supported by grants and donations from individual and institutional donors who believe in the value of the work and want to sustain it. In partnership with the American Journalism Project, we are building out a best-in-class development team to enable Spotlight PA to sustain and grow its reporting. Our expansion plans include the launch of Spotlight PA local bureaus in news deserts around the state. 

**What you’ll do:** The Major Gifts Director will lead Spotlight PA’s aggressive growth of its major individual giving, a vital pillar of our overall long-term revenue strategy. We are seeking an experienced fundraiser to help us meet the following ambitious targets over the next three years for major gifts ($1,000+): $450,000 in 2022; $750,000 in 2023; and $1 million in 2024. This position will report to the Senior Director of Strategic Development and be a part of a team that will include a Membership Manager. This team, in turn, will work closely with the Executive Director and key newsroom leaders to aggressively expand Spotlight PA’s fundraising sophistication and capacity.

**Responsibilities include:**

* Identify prospective donors with the capacity to give $1,000 or more annually, develop individual strategies, conduct personalized outreach and communication (in-person and virtually), and directly solicit major gifts from prospects throughout the year. 
* Plan and lead small-group solicitation events across Pennsylvania, including events hosted by current supporters. 
* Steward existing major donors through regular communications and impact reports related to their areas of interest. 
* Help with the creation of an annual report. 
* Conduct major donor digital campaigns and hard-mail solicitations to retain and upgrade existing donors. 
* Advance diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives on our team and through fundraising. 
* Work collaboratively with the Senior Director of Strategic Development and Membership Manager to identify current members who could be upgraded. 
* Partner with the Executive Director and Senior Director of Strategic Development to solicit major grants and corporate donations, and prepare reports for foundations and other institutional funders. 
* Track all major donor research, communications, pledges, and more in Salesforce.

**Who we’re looking for:** We are seeking a Pennsylvania-based fundraiser with a proven track record (at least 5-8 years of experience) in raising major gifts from individuals for important causes. Spotlight PA launched in late 2019, and most of our focus to date has been on grants and grassroots fundraising (membership); now, we are seeking to hire someone who believes deeply in the importance of non-partisan, independent journalism and has the experience, skills, and persistence to help Spotlight PA build an effective major gifts program. An ability to work in a collaborative environment is a must, as you will work closely with the Executive Director and the fundraising team, as well as external partners and advocates for our work. Applicants should have a passion for building relationships on behalf of the organizations they serve, and be goal-oriented and able to work independently. You should be a self-starter and have strong organizational and communication skills. You must also be committed to advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion on our team and through your work. 

**This job is full-time and includes benefits, and can be based anywhere in Pennsylvania. This position is budgeted for a salary from $90,000-$100,000, depending on experience. Applicants should include a resume and cover letter explaining why they’re a good fit for this role.** Note that the application portal is managed by The Philadelphia Inquirer — Spotlight PA is a fully grant- and donation-supported project of The Philadelphia Inquirer and The Lenfest Institute for Journalism. 

We know not everyone reading this will fit exactly what we’ve described. We encourage everyone to apply who shares our passion for indispensable journalism and our drive to create a sustainable business model to support it. Spotlight PA is committed to fostering a diverse and inclusive culture, and we especially encourage members of underrepresented communities to submit an application, including women, people of color, veterans, LGBTQ+ people, and individuals with disabilities.

* Keep all of our membership materials and marketing fresh and up-to-date.
* Develop and maintain creative and innovative partnerships to drive member growth. We are interested, for example, in partnering with a local food bank or another charitable organization during campaigns to incentivize membership and to give back to the communities we cover. 
* Manage all operations related to membership efforts, including gift processing and direct mail. 
* Respond to member questions in a timely and respectful fashion, and keep the “supporters” page on our website up-to-date.  
* Advance diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives on our team and through your external membership work.
* Collaborate with the Major Gifts Director and Senior Director of Strategic Development, and to identify individuals with the potential to give mid-level or major gifts.

**Who we’re looking for:** The membership director should have at least 2-3 years of experience executing print and/or online membership campaigns and conducting grassroots fundraising.

We welcome applications from individuals with experience in grassroots fundraising, membership programs, and email marketing across a wide spectrum of industries, or from within journalism itself. We also encourage those with these skills who have taken other career paths to apply.

An ability to work in a collaborative environment is a must. We’re an agile startup that values camaraderie, and everyone on our team pitches in across the organization and brings a sense of urgency and drive to their work every day. We also value innovation, creativity, and originality, and we’re always seeking to explore new and experimental ways of connecting with readers and members.

**This job is full-time and includes benefits, and is fully remote, though a home base in Pennsylvania is preferred. This position is budgeted for a salary from $65,000-$75,000, depending on experience. Applicants should include a resume and cover letter explaining why they’re a good fit for this role.**
